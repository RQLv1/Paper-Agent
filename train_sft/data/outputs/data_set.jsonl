In this work, home-made porous anodic alumina (PAA) templates with different pore diameters were prepared firstly, which would be used as a substrate [20]. Then, the wanted TiO2 film was deposited on the PAA substrate by using the reactive DC magnetron sputtering method at room temperature. In the sputtering process, a high-purity Ti disk (φ = 50 mm) was used as the sputtering target, and the working and reactive gases were 99.99% pure argon and oxygen, respectively. The vacuum base pressure was better than 1 × 10−4 Pa and the working pressure was fixed at 0.8 Pa. The flux ratio of the argon to oxygen was kept at 10:1 by adjusting the flux of the argon at 20 sccm and oxygen at 2 sccm during sputtering. At the same time, a sputtering power of 60 W was selected to ensure the perfect samples. Next, the as-synthesized TiO2/PAA composite films were annealed at 400 °C in the air condition for 2 h to gain the final samples. For discrimination, the TiO2/PAA composite films are labeled as S1, S2, S3, and S4 for samples with different pore diameters. The average pore diameter was 40, 46, 49, and 55 nm for S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively, while the thickness was 166, 162, 160, and 156 nm. Finally, after pre-treatment, a silver paste was painted or spun on the composite film as the top electrode for the next dielectric properties measurement.\nDielectric constants were calculated according to the sample geometry and its parameters were measured on a precision impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294A) in a frequency range of 10 kHz to 30 MHz at room temperature.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "3 Green synthesis of ZIF-8 The synthesis methods for ZIF-8 encompass a diverse range, categorized broadly into solvent-dependent methods, which rely on various liquid mediums to facilitate reaction and crystallization, and solvent-free methods, which aim to achieve synthesis without the use of liquid solvents, emphasizing sustainability and process efficiency [61]. The four key reaction parameters—molar ratio (M), pouring time (P), water content (W), and temperature (T)—each play a critical role in controlling the size and growth of ZIF-8 particles (Fig. 3 ). W influences the concentration of the solution, with a higher water content resulting in fewer nuclei formation, leading to larger particle sizes. As the concentration increases, more nuclei are formed, which leads to smaller particles in the range of 250–750 nm. T also affects the growth of ZIF-8, where an increase in temperature accelerates the growth process and results in larger particles, ranging from 350 to 900 nm, due to enhanced kinetics and fast crystal growth. P impacts the availability of Zn2+ ions in the solution, and faster pouring leads to rapid nucleation and smaller particle sizes (150–510 nm), as the zinc ions are consumed quickly. Conversely, slower pouring allows for more controlled growth, leading to larger particles. Finally, M between Zn2+ and the organic ligand (2-mIm) controls nucleation density. A higher molar ratio promotes more nuclei formation, yielding smaller particles, while a lower molar ratio results in larger particles due to fewer nuclei being formed. Overall, these parameters work together to fine-tune the particle size of ZIF-8, ranging from 150 nm to 900 nm [62]. 3.1 Solvent-dependent methods In synthesizing ZIF-8, the choice of solvent is crucial for economic and environmental considerations. The solvents used in ZIF-8 synthesis are categorized into organic solvents like DMF, methanol, and inorganic solvents such as water. Methanol, for instance, can act as a guest molecule that is easily removed post-synthesis by washing with acid like HCl or by heating, or it can function both as a linker and a guest molecule [61]. Water-based solvents are preferred for green synthesis due to their economic and environmental benefits, as they are easy to prepare and pose minimal safety risks [63]. 3.1.1 Hydrothermal synthesis Hydrothermal green synthesis of ZIF-8 is a sustainable method that minimizes environmental impact. This approach enables the rapid formation of ZIF-8 crystals while avoiding harmful solvents and complex reagents (Fig. 4 ). The 'green' aspect of this method lies in its use of water as the primary solvent and its reduced reliance on energy-intensive procedures, aligning with environmentally friendly practices in materials synthesis. A notable example of this approach is presented by Li et al., who developed a green synthesis method for creating defect-free ZIF-8 membranes. Their process involves the self-conversion of ZnO nanorods on a porous substrate, where water acts as the solvent. In this method, ZnO nanorods function both as the zinc source and as nucleation sites in a zinc-free 2-methylimidazole solution. Importantly, the synthesis solution used in this method can be recycled multiple times, which not only reduces waste but also enhances the environmental friendliness and cost-effectiveness of the process, making it suitable for scalable production of ZIF-8 membranes [47]. Another significant study in the realm of hydrothermal green synthesis focuses on the creation of ZIF-8 decorated with CoFe2O4 spinel nanoparticles. In this research, the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles are derived from agricultural bio-waste, specifically potato peel extract. This method not only utilizes waste materials but also results in the formation of a ZIF@CoFe2O4 composite that exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The composite’s superior catalytic properties underline its potential for sustainable and cost-effective hydrogen production, further demonstrating the benefits of incorporating green synthesis techniques [64]. Additionally, a different study explores the hydrothermal synthesis of MnO2@ZIF-8 core–shell nanoparticles. In this approach, ZIF-8 crystals are first grown with controlled morphology and size by modulating crystal growth with a peptide. The synthesis is followed by the in-situ coating of MnO2, with its surface density controlled through the dosage of potassium permanganate (KMnO4). This method not only highlights the versatility of hydrothermal synthesis but also the ability to tailor the properties of the ZIF-8 materials for specific applications [65]. 3.1.2 Ionothermal synthesis Ionothermal synthesis is a green synthesis method [66] for preparing porous materials, including ZIF-8, which involves using ionic liquids (ILs) as solvents. This eco-friendly approach benefits from the absence of vapor pressure from ILs, allowing the synthesis to be conducted in open vessels under normal pressure, thereby eliminating the risks associated with high autogenous pressures in sealed autoclaves [67]. ILs not only serve as solvents but also provide template cations that facilitate the formation of the desired organic frameworks [68]. This method enhances the efficiency, safety, and environmental sustainability of synthesizing ZIF-8, making it a promising technique in the field of materials science. Ban et al. employed room-temperature ionic liquids in a sustainable green ionothermal synthesis process to modify the microenvironment of ZIF-8. By using these ionic liquids, the researchers can precisely adjust and control the pore size of ZIF-8. This approach enhances the material's properties for various applications by fine-tuning its structural characteristics [69]. 3.1.3 Deep eutectic method The deep eutectic method for synthesizing ZIF-8, as introduced by Hu et al., offers a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional synthesis techniques. This method operates near room temperature without the need for organic solvents, utilizing a stoichiometric molar ratio of zinc salt and imidazole [70]. The key innovation lies in forming a deep eutectic solvent (DES) between quaternary ammonium salt and imidazole. DESs are now widely acknowledged as “green solvents” because of their low vapor pressure, nonflammability, low toxicity, and biodegradability [71,72]. The DES facilitates the deprotonation of 2-methylimidazole (2-Mim) and promotes its coordination with Zn2+ ions, accelerating the nucleation and growth of ZIF-8. This environmentally friendly process not only reduces energy consumption but also minimizes chemical waste, aligning with the principles of green chemistry. ZIF-8 synthesized via the deep eutectic method exhibits superior properties compared to those produced by conventional methods. Notably, it features both micropores and mesopores due to the template role of the quaternary ammonium salt, resulting in a higher surface area and larger pore volume. These characteristics significantly enhance the material's capacity for CO2 adsorption, making it highly effective for gas storage and separation applications. The combination of improved performance and environmental benefits positions the deep eutectic method as a highly attractive approach for the synthesis of ZIFs, meeting the demands for sustainable and high-performing materials [73]. 3.1.4 Rapid synthesis of hierarchical porous ZIFs The Rapid Synthesis of Hierarchical Porous ZIF-8 method represents a novel and efficient approach to producing ZIF materials, specifically ZIF-8, ZIF-61, and ZIF-90. In studies by Duan et al. and Zhang et al., this method leverages the use of organic amines as crucial components in the synthesis process, resulting in several significant advancements over traditional methods [74,75]. Unlike the conventional solvothermal methods that require prolonged reaction times of up to 24 h and high temperatures and pressures, this new method achieves rapid synthesis in as little as one minute at room temperature and pressure. This considerable reduction in energy consumption and processing time not only makes the process more environmentally friendly but also economically viable. Organic amines play a dual role in this innovative synthesis approach. First, they act as protonation agents, facilitating the deprotonation of organic ligands, which is essential for the formation of ZIF crystals. This step simplifies the nucleation and growth of ZIF structures. Secondly, organic amines serve as structure-directing agents, guiding the formation of mesopores and macropores within the ZIF structure, thus contributing to the hierarchical porous nature of the synthesized materials [67,76]. Zhang et al. highlight a particularly impressive aspect of this method: the achievement of a high Space Time Yield (STY) of 1.59 × 104 kg m−3 d−1. This metric underscores the efficiency of the synthesis process in terms of product yield per unit volume and time, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional methods. The method not only accelerates the synthesis of ZIF-8 but also enables the production of hierarchical porous structures, such as ZIF-61 and ZIF-90, with tailored properties. These materials are highly desirable for applications in catalysis, separation, and sensing due to their high surface areas, tunable pore sizes, and enhanced chemical and thermal stability [75]. In summary, the Rapid Synthesis of Hierarchical Porous ZIF method represents a significant advancement in ZIF synthesis technology. It offers a rapid, environmentally friendly, and economically feasible production route for versatile hierarchical porous ZIF materials. These materials hold great promise for various industrial and scientific applications that require advanced porous materials, marking a considerable step forward in the field of material science. 3.1.5 Supercritical CO2 synthesis The supercritical CO2 (scCO2) synthesis method for ZIF-8 leverages scCO2’s unique physical and chemical properties to enhance the synthesis process, positioning it as a notable advancement in green chemistry [77]. Supercritical CO2 is recognized for its environmental benefits and its application in green chemistry due to several advantageous properties. By adjusting pressure and temperature, the density of scCO2 can be controlled, impacting reaction equilibrium and the solubility of reactants. Its gas-like viscosity and diffusivity facilitate faster reaction kinetics through improved mass and heat transfer. Additionally, the near-zero surface tension of scCO2 simplifies the wetting and penetration of porous materials, which influences reaction pathways and interfacial energies. The rapid depressurization after synthesis can quench reactions quickly, reducing agglomeration and enhancing the formation of desirable nanostructures with high surface areas [78]. ZIF-8 synthesized using scCO2, offering a greener alternative to traditional methods that rely on organic solvents or aqueous systems. Key studies have demonstrated the benefits of using scCO2 for ZIF-8 synthesis. Sinnwell et al.'s investigations utilized in-situ XRD, ex-situ microscopy, and simulations to study the formation of ZIF-8 and intermediary ZnO@ZIF-8 composites. They found that the rate of ZIF-8 formation correlated with the surface area of the ZnO source, providing insights into the reaction kinetics and the effect of isobaric temperature changes on crucial reaction variables [79]. Furthermore, Marrett et al.'s study showcased a scalable method to synthesize ZIF-8 from ZnO using scCO2, eliminating the need for catalysts and traditional solvents. They achieved quantitative conversion of ZnO to ZIF-8 in minutes, producing up to 100 g of ZIF-8 in just 1 h [80]. The application of scCO2 in the synthesis of ZIF-8 offers several advantages. The use of scCO2 aligns with green chemistry principles, reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional solvents. The ability to fine-tune physical conditions such as pressure and temperature allows for precise control over the synthesis process. Faster kinetics and better mass transfer result in high-purity ZIF-8 with desirable nanostructures and large surface areas. Rapid depressurization helps avoid complex separation procedures, leading to the efficient recovery of the synthesized product [81,82]. The application of scCO2 in the synthesis of ZIF-8 exemplifies a significant advancement in green chemistry, offering a sustainable, efficient, and scalable method for producing high-quality metal–organic frameworks. The studies by Sinnwell et al. and Marrett et al. highlight the potential of scCO2 to revolutionize the synthesis of ZIF-8 and possibly other MOFs, contributing to the development of environmentally friendly and industrially viable chemical processes [83]. 3.1.6 Synthesis of ZIF-8 using liquid metals The synthesis of ZIF-8 using liquid metals introduces an innovative method leveraging post-transition metal-based liquid alloys, like gallium-zinc mixtures, as reactive media for chemical reactions. In this approach, the gallium-zinc liquid alloy undergoes anodization while immersed in a solution containing an organic linker (such as imidazolate) and an aprotic electrolyte. This process releases reactive zinc ions from the alloy, which then combine with the organic linker to form the ZIF-8 structure. Notably, this synthesis occurs under mild conditions—near room temperature, low potentials, and short reaction times—making it both energy-efficient and scalable. The resulting ZIF-8 exhibits a unique stratified structure, potentially enhancing its properties, such as porosity and catalytic behavior. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a high ionization tendency of zinc atoms in the alloy, facilitating their incorporation into the framework. A proof-of-concept continuous liquid metal-based reactor demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale production of the stratified zinc-organic framework, showcasing the potential of liquid metals to revolutionize the synthesis of metal–organic frameworks efficiently and effectively [84]. The synthesis of ZIF-8 using liquid metals by Zheng et al, specifically a eutectic Zn-Ga alloy, offers a novel approach to enhancing interfacial reactions. Liquid metals allow for the free movement of solute metals like Zn, which enriches the interface and improves the coordination between Zn2+ ions and organic linkers, leading to the efficient formation of highly crystalline and porous ZIF-8. In this method, a liquid Zn-Ga alloy is used as the anode in an electrosynthesis process, where an electric potential ionizes Zn2+, allowing it to coordinate with deprotonated organic linkers to form ZIF-8 crystals. The eutectic Zn-Ga system, containing 3.6 wt% Zn, provides the highest reaction rate and crystal quality due to Zn enrichment at the interface, which reduces interference from Ga and lowers the energy required for the reaction. DFT calculations show that Zn2+ in the liquid alloy exhibits stronger interaction with organic linkers compared to solid-state Zn, further enhancing the synthesis process. This method is energy-efficient and scalable, offering potential for broader applications in the synthesis of other zeolite-based frameworks [85]. 3.2 Solvent-free methods Solvent-free methods for synthesizing ZIFs are emerging techniques that avoid the use of organic solvents, making the process more environmentally friendly and cost-effective. These methods often involve the use of solid-state reactions or mechanochemical approaches, where the metal sources and organic linkers are mixed and reacted under mechanical force, such as grinding or milling, or through other solid-phase techniques. By eliminating solvents, these methods reduce the environmental impact and simplify the processing, while still achieving high-quality ZIF materials with desirable properties [86]. 3.2.1 Mechanochemical synthesis A scalable and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing well-dispersed ZIF-8 nanoparticles is achieved through mechanochemical processing, particularly reactive ball milling. This technique is favored for its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, allowing rapid reactions at near-room temperature with high yields while minimizing the use of solvents and waste disposal issues. Mechanochemical processing, which utilizes mechanical energy to activate surfaces and create localized heating, has produced porous ZIFs with controlled properties and structures. This approach highlights the potential of reactive ball milling as a sustainable and green method for commercial-scale nanomaterial production [87]. In the mechanochemical synthesis of ZIF-8, precursors typically include zinc sources like zinc acetate and imidazole or its derivatives, which react under mechanical activation to form the zeolitic imidazolate framework (Fig. 5 ). Tanaka et al reported an efficient mechanosynthesis method for creating ZIF-8 with a hierarchical superstructure using only precursor powders. The process involves a solid–solid mechanochemical reaction with zinc acetate dihydrate, which accelerates the conversion of ZnO to ZIF-8 by generating the necessary reactive agents. This results in a material with excellent adsorption properties and significant potential for large-scale industrial use [88]. Bogdan et al. developed ZIF-8 using a mechanochemical synthesis method, which was subsequently combined with titanium tetraisopropoxide via hydrothermal synthesis at 150 °C. This approach highlights a straightforward and efficient strategy for designing and fabricating MOF-derived materials through an unconventional synthesis route. Additionally, it demonstrates the environmental benefits of mechanochemical synthesis for preparing composite or hybrid materials [89]. 3.2.2 Vapor-assisted conversion (VAC) synthesis VAC is an innovative and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing MOFs, including zeolites and zeolite-like porous materials. One of the key reasons VAC is considered a green approach is its ability to reduce the consumption of organic solvents significantly. Unlike traditional solvothermal methods, where solvents and solutes are mixed and often require large volumes of organic solvents, VAC keeps the solvent and solute separate. This separation minimizes the need for excessive solvent usage, addressing a major environmental concern associated with conventional synthesis techniques. Typically, VAC employs polar solvents such as DMF, diethylformamide (DEF), and methanol. However, recent developments have introduced nonpolar solvents like n-heptane into the process, enhancing the method's versatility. A notable application of VAC is in the synthesis of ZIF-8 (Zn(MIM)2, where MIM is 2-methylimidazole). Research by Zhang et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of VAC with various solvents, including methanol, DMF, and n-heptane. They found that the particle sizes of ZIF-8 varied depending on the solvent: 10–20 μm for methanol, 60–90 μm for DMF, and 30–50 μm for n-heptane. The use of n-heptane was particularly noteworthy as it was the first instance of a nonpolar solvent being used in VAC for ZIF-8 synthesis. The method required only 0.5 mL of solvent, which is a significant reduction compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the transformation rate from solid reagents to ZIF-8 was faster with n-heptane compared to methanol or DMF [90]. The synthesis of ZIF-8 can be categorized into solvent-dependent and solvent-free methods, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Solvent-dependent methods, including hydrothermal, ionothermal, deep eutectic, rapid synthesis, and supercritical CO2, vary in their solvent use, which ranges from water and ionic liquids to deep eutectic solvents and supercritical CO2. These methods offer benefits like reduced environmental impact, faster synthesis, and high-purity products but may require specific conditions or equipment, and some involve higher costs. For example, hydrothermal and ionothermal methods typically produce micrometer-sized ZIF-8 with octahedral or irregular shapes, while supercritical CO2 synthesis achieves nanometer to micrometer-sized ZIF-8 with similar shapes. On the other hand, solvent-free methods like mechanochemical synthesis and VAC are environmentally friendly and cost-effective, producing ZIF-8 with controlled properties and often irregular shapes. Mechanochemical synthesis eliminates solvents entirely by using mechanical force to facilitate reactions, while VAC significantly reduces solvent use. Each method presents unique trade-offs in terms of synthesis speed, environmental impact, and material characteristics, as summarized in the accompanying Table 1 .", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "ZIF-8", "Syns_method": "deep eutectic", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2", "amount": "stoichiometric molar ratio with imidazole"}, "prc2": {"name": "imidazole", "amount": "stoichiometric molar ratio with Zn(NO3)2"}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "ZIF-8", "Syns_method": "liquid metal anodization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Zn-Ga alloy (3.6 wt% Zn)", "amount": "eutectic mixture"}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "ZIF@CoFe2O4", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "CoFe2O4 nanoparticles", "amount": "from potato peel extract"}, "prc2": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2", "amount": "stoichiometric molar ratio with 2-mIm"}, "prc3": {"name": "2-methylimidazole", "amount": "stoichiometric molar ratio with Zn(NO3)2"}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "MnO2@ZIF-8", "Syns_method": "in-situ coating", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "ZIF-8", "amount": "crystals grown with peptide"}, "prc2": {"name": "KMnO4", "amount": "controlled dosage"}}}}, "MAT5": {"name": "ZIF-8", "Syns_method": "VAC", "Syns_processing": {"solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C7H16", "amount": "0.5 mL"}}}}}}

The starting liquid concentration in the reactor was a 0.167 mol L−1 sulfate mixture (NiSO4·6H2O, CoSO4·7H2O, and MnSO4·H2O) with a molar ratio of 1:1:4 (Ni:Co:Mn). The total volume was 6 L. The feed liquid concentration was a 2 mol L−1 sulfate mixture with the same molar ratio. The feed speed was 2 mL min−1. The precipitator was a 2 mol L−1 Na2CO3 solution. The complexing agent was a 0.3 mol L−1 ammonia water. These two were pre-mixed. The pH value, stirring speed, and temperature were controlled as 8.0, 500 rpm, and 50 °C, respectively. Total feeding time of sulfate mixture, precipitator, and complexing agent was 18 h. After that, the obtained precipitate was filtered with 3000 mesh filter cloth, washed and dried at 120 °C for 12 h.\nPreparation of precursor after nano-grinding\nFifteen grams of BGP was ball milled with a rotation speed 400 r min−1 for an hour. The weight ratio of ball to material was about 1:2.5.

The half-cell tests were performed by using two-electrode coin cells (CR2032; Shenzhen Neware Electronics Co., Ltd.) with metallic Li as the counter and reference electrode. Celgard 2400 (Celgard) was used as a separator. The electrolyte was 1 mol L−1 LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (3:7, v/v). The galvanostatic charge-discharge and cycling performance measurements were performed between 2.5 and 5.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) on a Land CT2001C Battery at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were both measured on a Zennium electrochemical analyzer (ZAHNER-elektrik GmbH & Co.

Then, cathode slurry was coated on Al foil using the coating machine and vacuum dried at 85 °C for 12 h. Finally, Al foil with loading was stamped by the punching machine with the dimension 56 mm × 43 mm.\nThe anode electrode was manufactured by mixing graphite powder (Jiangsu Chunlan Clean Energy Research Institute Co., Ltd.), conductive agent XPB565, SFG6, and PVDF with a mass ration of 92:1:3:4. Oxalic acid is added (1.2 g per 100 g anode powder). The above mixture was put into the pulp making machine and stirred in vacuum for 6 h. NMP was added to adjust viscosity to 4000~5000 mPa s.

LTD; PTFE films are from Nanjing Sinoma Membrane Material Co. LTD; Nafion (5 wt%) is from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., LTD; H2O2 (30 wt%) is from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co. LTD; KMnO4 and H2SO4 (95.0–98.0 wt%) is from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co. LTD; NaNO3 is from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent Factory. All other solvents and reagents (obtained from Aldrich) were reagent grade and were used as received. 2.2 Preparation of sample 2.2.1 Preparation of TiO2 modified PTFE film PTFE film is immersed in acetone and ethanol in turns. 1.5 mL of etraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), 1 mL of acetylacetone, and 75 mL of ethanol are mixed uniformity in a Teflon-lined vessel. Then the PTFE film after immersion is tiled in the bottom of vessel and tightly closed for hydrothermal reaction (180 °C, 24 h). 2.2.2 Preparation of GO Aqueous dispersions of GO were synthesized by the improved Hummers' method from purified natural graphite [41]. 2.2.3 Preparation of composite membrane PTFE films were hydrophilic modified with TiO2 by hydrothermal method. Then GO nanolayer was deposited on TiO2 modified PTFE film by simple suction method [39,40,42]. Subsequently, the complex was sprayed with Nafion emulsion and finally the composite membrane was made by hot press molding. 2.3 Characterization The transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Ltd. Japan) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quant 250FEG, America) were employed to collect the morphology characteristics. Contact angle images were collected by using a contact angle measurement instrument (JGW-360, China).X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected by using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) from 5 to 80°. Raman spectra was recorded with a Raman Spectrometer (Invia, England). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was acquired by a PHI Quantera II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Ulvac-Phi, Japan). The FT-IR data was collected by a Thermo Nicolet iS10 FT-IR Spectrometer (USA). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis was performed by using TGA5500. And the samples were characterized with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (isothermal heating at 105 °C for 20 min). The angle-resolved XPS (ARXPS) data was collected to confirm the thickness of GO by the following algorithms [43–46]: (1) d = 3λsinα (2) λ ≈ 0.096 E k (3) E k = hv - E b where d is the thickness of layer, λ is the attenuation length of electron, α is the take-off angle measured, and Ek is the kinetic energy, Eb is the binding energy, and hv is 1253.6 eV (Mg Kα excitation source). The proton conductivity of the fully hydrated membranes was measured via the AC impedance analyzer (Hioki 3532-50) gain phase analyzer over the frequency range of 10 Hz–100 kHz. The conductivity of the membranes was measured at the relative humidity of 100% which was fixed for all the samples. The conductivity–temperature relationship of membranes was further based on the following Arrhenius equation [47]: (4) σ = σ 0 · e − E a R T where, σ is proton conductivity, σ0 is preexponential parameter, Ea is activation energy, R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. Swelling ratio (SR) and water content (WC) are tested to the characterize dimensional stability and water absorption of the membranes by measuring the changes in their size and weight between dried and hydrated states. Swelling ratio and water content are calculated by the following equations: (5) SR ( % ) = S 1 − S 0 S 0 ∗ 100 % (6) WC ( % ) = M 1 − M 0 M 0 ∗ 100 % Where, S0 and S1 is the size of membrane on the dried and hydrated states, respectively. M0 and M1 is the mass of membrane on the dried and hydrated states, respectively. The tensile strength of dry membranes is measured with stretching rate of 50 mm min−1 using a strength tester (SHIMAZUAGS-100NX) at 25 °C. The oxidative stability (OS) of membranes is evaluated according to Fenton's test as previously reported with some modifications [48]. Briefly, the membrane is immersed in Fenton's reagent at 80 °C for 1 h (Fenton reagent: 3% H2O2 and 0.04 mg mL−1 FeSO4). The oxidative stability is calculated by their retained weights percent after immersion: (7) OS ( % ) = W 1 W 0 ∗ 100 % Where, W0 and W1 is the weight of membrane before and after immersion in Fenton's reagent. The hydrogen permeability was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique using a potentiostat (CHI760C, China) at room temperature. According to the Faraday's Law, the hydrogen permeation of MEA can be obtained by the following formula: The hydrogen crossover was determined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) as described elsewhere (8) J = I A · n · F where, J is the hydrogen flux (mA cm−2), I is current, A is the active area of MEA, n is the number of electrons gained or lost, and F is the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol−1). Then, hydrogen permeability coefficient can be calculated by the was calculated using the following equation [49,50].

The methanol permeability was determined by using a two-compartment glass diffusion cell (Fig. S1). Briefly, methanol solution was placed on one side (A) and pure water was placed on the other side (B). The methanol concentration in cell B was measured by gas chromatography method. The methanol permeability was calculated by the following equation: (10) P m = 2 q L A · t ( C A 0 + C A − C B ) ∗ 1000 where, Pm is methanol permeability (cm2 s−1), q is the quality of permeated methanol (g), L is the membrane thickness (cm), A is membrane area (cm2), t is the penetration time (s), CA0 is the initial concentration of cell A, CA and CB is methanol concentration in cell A and B (mol L−1), respectively.

The as-prepared MEAs were performed in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell single cell, respectively. The performance of direct methanol fuel cell prepared from Nafion117 and TiO2 Modified PTFE Film/GO @Nafion composite membrane was tested at different temperature (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 °C) using a fuel cell test station (Hephas Energy co. model 890e, China). The input flow rate of methanol at the anode was 5 mL min−1 with 1 M methanol solution, and the cathode input O2 flow rate was 100 mL min−1 with 0.3 MPa. The performance of hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell was operated at different temperature of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Abstract\nWith the advantages of abundant resources, high specific capacity, and relatively stable cycling performance, silicon suboxides (SiOx, x < 2) have been recently suggested as promising anodes for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). SiOx exhibits superior storage capability because of the presence of silicon and smaller volume change upon charge/discharge than Si owing to the buffering effect of the initial lithiation products of inert lithium oxide and lithium silicates, enabling a stable cycle life of electrodes. However, significant improvements, such as overcoming issues related to volume changes in cycling and initial irreversible capacity loss and enhancing the ionic and electronic charge transport in poorly conducting SiOx electrodes, are still needed to achieve the satisfactory performance required for commercial applications. This review summarizes recent progress on the cycling performance and initial coulombic efficiency of SiOx. Advances in the design of particle morphology and composite composition, prelithiation and prereduction methods, and usage of electrolyte additives and optimized electrode binders are discussed. Perspectives on the promising research directions that might lead to further improvement of the electrochemical properties of SiOx-based anodes are noted.

MIL-96, MIL-100 and MIL-110 are drastically different in their node structures. Following our previous reported results for MIL-100, we report the modified synthesis and characterization of the node sites of MIL-110 and MIL-96 and their catalytic sites by using methanol dehydration as probe reaction. We show that these MOFs can be synthesized from the same solution by adding various amounts of formic acid as modulator. Herein, the chemistry of hydroxyl, formate and methoxy groups were used to probe the three MOFs’ node sites. IR data show the bonding structures of these ligands are highly diverse, with reactivities and flexibilities depending on node sites. We identified terminal OH group and various µ2-OH groups in single, paired or hydrogen bonded modes on the MOF nodes. Formate ligands were introduced to the node sites during the synthesis or by a post treatment in formic acid/DMF solution. Surprisingly, the bonding modes of formate ligands on Al3(OH)3 node structure of MIL-96 can be reversibly switched between monodentate and bidentate through a process induced by water molecules. Further, methoxy ligands—likely to be the intermediate for catalytic reaction—were also observed on the node sites under methanol dehydration conditions at 250 ℃. The activities of MIL-100 and MIL-96 for methanol dehydration determined by TOF per node were similar, both approximately 3-fold higher than that of MIL-110. The data suggests that catalytic sites incorporate adjacent vacancy and defect node sites, which constitute a minority among all observed MOF node sites. We foresee the opportunities in expanding the chemistry and understanding into other MOFs with metal oxide cluster nodes.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "MIL-96", "application": "catalyst for methanol dehydration", "props": {"activity (TOF per node)": "3-fold higher than MIL-110 @ 250 ℃"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "MIL-100", "application": "catalyst for methanol dehydration", "props": {"activity (TOF per node)": "3-fold higher than MIL-110 @ 250 ℃"}}, "MAT3": {"name": "MIL-110", "application": "catalyst for methanol dehydration", "props": {}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experiment 2.1 Reagents and solutions Methylene blue (C16H20ClN3OS), anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2), and sodium alginate were purchased from Sinopharm Reagent Co. Nitric acid (HNO3, 65 wt%), dopamine hydrochloride (C8H12ClNO2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and tris-HCI (pH = 8.5) were purchased from Qingdao Leibosys Technology Co. All chemicals are analytical grade. All solutions were configured using deionized (DI) water. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, purity >97 %), purchased from Shenzhen Technology Co. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Preparation of polydopamine‑carbon nanotubes In the experiment, 100 mg of the MWCNTs were dispersed by sonication in 100 mL of Tris-HCI (pH = 8.5) buffer, followed by 200 mg of dopamine hydrochloride. Stirring was continued for 12 h to ensure complete polymerization of PDA [14]. The black powder was collected by centrifugation and washed with DI water. Finally, the P-CNTs were obtained by freeze-drying the black powder. 2.2.2 Preparation of polydopamine‑carbon nanotubes/calcium alginate aerogel Fig. 1 shows the steps of the P-CNTs/CA aerogel preparation. First, 60 mg of P-CNTs were dispersed into 20 mL of DI water by sonication, and then 400 mg of calcium alginate was added. Continuous stirring was performed to form a homogeneous solution, which was then freeze-dried for 24 h to obtain P-CNTs/sodium alginate aerogel. The P-CNTs/sodium alginate aerogel was soaked in a low concentration of calcium chloride solution for 12 h for crosslinking. After the crosslinking was washed several times to remove unreacted calcium ions, it was freeze-dried again for 24 h and named P-CNTs/CA aerogel. The P-CNTs/CA aerogels containing different masses of P-CNTs were prepared using the same method. After adsorption tests (Fig. S3), the aerogel with the highest adsorption capacity was selected for batch adsorption experiments. 2.3 Material characterization The adsorbent's surface morphology and surface elements were characterized with a JSM-78OOF scanning electron microscope. The P-CNTs/CA aerogel were analyzed by FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy before and after adsorption. Thermal stability was obtained using a simultaneous thermal analyzer (SDT650, USA). The surface charge of the P-CNTs/CA aerogel was obtained by zeta potentiometry. The surface area and pore volume of the P-CNTs/CA aerogel were obtained using a BET analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP2460-2 M, Mike, USA). The surface elements of the P-CNTs/CA aerogel were analyzed using XPS. 2.4 Batch adsorption experiment Batch adsorption experiments were conducted with contact time, pH, adsorbent dose, temperature, and initial concentration as variables. All adsorption experiments were performed using 20 mL of MB solution and 10 mg of adsorbent. Adsorption experiments with contact time as a variable used a 100 mg‧L−1 solution of MB, and the residual concentration was measured at different times until the adsorption equilibrium was reached. The adsorption experiments (initial concentration) used MB solutions in the 30–150 mg‧L−1 concentration range and were carried out at three temperatures (298 K, 308 K, 318 K). For experiments where adsorbent dose (2–20 mg) and pH (4–10) were variables, the MB solution concentration remained at 100 mg‧L−1. The adsorption experiments were carried out in a thermostatic water bath shaker set at 150 rpm and kept in a dark environment. The adsorption equilibrium time was taken as 30 h. After adsorption equilibrium, the remaining concentration of MB in the supernatant was measured (TU-1810, wavelength 664 nm). The equations for calculating the equilibrium adsorption amount and the adsorption amount at time t are as follows [22]: (1) q e = C 0 − C e m V (2) q t = C 0 − C t m V The equation to calculate the equilibrium removal rate is as follows: (3) Removal = C 0 − C e C 0 × 100 % where q e (mg‧g−1) is the adsorption capacity at adsorption equilibrium, and q t (mg‧g−1) is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at the moment t; C 0 , C e , and C t (mg‧L−1) are the initial concentration of the MB solution, the remaining concentration at the moment t, and the remaining concentration at adsorption equilibrium. m (g) is the mass of adsorbent. V (L) is the volume of the MB solution. 2.5 Density functional theory DFT calculations only qualitatively analyze the adsorption mechanism. The primary computational tool utilized was ORCA [25]. In the generalized gradient approximation, geometry optimization utilizes the DFT-D3-corrected parameterization of the BYLP exchange-correlation function and the double-ζ numerical basis (def2-SVP) atomically localized set of orbitals [26–28]. The set of atomically fixed domain orbitals using a triple ζ-value basis (def2-TZVP) located on the atom was used for single-point energy calculations [29,30]. The solvation model (SMD) dealt with solvation effects [31]. The Multiwfn program and visual merchandising (VMD) were used to process the calculations [32]. Fig. S1 shows the computational models. The adsorption energy between adsorbent and adsorbate can be obtained from equations [33]: (4) E bd = E AB − E A − E B where E AB is the system's total energy, E A is the energy of the adsorbent, and E B is the energy of the adsorbate.

A homogeneous precursor solution was achieved after 30 minutes of stirring in an argon-filled glove box. Afterwards, 0.1 M pBQ redox mediator was added to the solution and agitated for one hour to obtain a homogeneous solution of polymer electrolyte precursor and redox mediator. For polymerization, 30 μL of tin catalyst was added to the precursor solution. The resultant solution was cast on a microporous membrane of Whatman paper separator which was mounted on a PTFE plate. The precursor solution filled the pores of the separator, which was then placed in an oven at 60 °C for 3 hours for further polymerization and drying before being transferred to a vacuum oven for further 3 hours of drying at 80 °C. Finally, we obtain a uniform polymer film with pBQ and cut it into a 16 mm diameter for use in Li–O2 batteries. To put that in perspective, the same method is used to generate polymer electrolytes without pBQ.\nFor fabrication of the cathode, a homogeneous slurry was obtained using 85% CNTs and 15% PVDF binder when mixed in a N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution for 30 minutes using a pestle and mortar. The mass loading of CNTs on the surface of carbon paper is ∼0.1–0.5 mg cm−2. After loading, the cathode was dried in a vacuum oven for one night at 80 °C. Finally, the CNT pasted cathode was cut into a diameter of 10 mm for assembling Li–O2 batteries.\nThe testing cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box with the concentrations of water and oxygen being less than 0.1 ppm. An MSTP polymer electrolyte with 0.1 M pBQ redox mediator (w/pBQ) is placed between the cathode and the anode. Through the gas inlet and outlet, the cell was oxygenated for 20 minutes to create a pure oxygen environment within the home-made glass bottle, which was then carefully sealed to enclose oxygen gas inside the bottle. The galvanostatic discharge–charge tests were carried out using the LAND battery testing system. Variations in specific capacity were measured on the basis of weight of CNTs on carbon paper.\nThe ionic conductivity of the polymer film with pBQ (0.1 M) was examined by EIS using a Versa STAT 3 system at different temperatures. The polymer film was implanted between two SS (stainless-steel) plate electrodes and a 10 mV AC amplitude was used to record the spectra throughout a frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz. The impedance spectrum was used to calculate the bulk resistance (Rb) of the film. The ionic conductivity (σ) was computed using the equation, σ = L/RbS, where Rb, L and S are the bulk resistance, thickness and area of the polymer film with the pBQ film, respectively. Ex situ SEM was used to investigate the morphology of discharge products on the cathode surface after disassembling of a fully discharge Li–O2 battery in an Ar filled glove box. Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406) was used for the X-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8 Focus powder X-ray diffractometer. To prevent the discharge products from reacting with air, the samples were put onto a glass substrate and subsequently sealed with a Kapton polyimide sheet. Ex situ SEM, XRD, and XPS were carried out to examine the pristine, discharged, and recharged stages of each composite cathode, respectively. The composite cathodes in discharged or charged states were carefully shifted to the SEM chamber without being exposed to air for a long period of time for SEM characterization.\n", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "MSTP/pBQ polymer electrolyte", "Syns_method": "solution casting polymerization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "MSTP", "amount": "1.5 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "LiTFSI", "amount": "2.5 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "1,4-benzoquinone (pBQ)", "amount": "0.1 M"}, "prc4": {"name": "tin catalyst", "amount": "30 µL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "TEGDME", "amount": "5 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "3 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "3 h"}}}}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis of RGO-TiO2 nanocomposites To begin with, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized using the modified Hummers method [11], after which the one-step hydrothermal method was used to generate TiO2 nanocomposite structures with four different RGO ratios. Accordingly, 1 ml of titanium (IV) isopropoxide was added to mixtures of 8 ml of ethanol and 2 ml of deionized water in four different containers and stirred at 600 rpm. In the following stage, 20 ml of deionized water was added to the solutions as the stirring process was underway, and stirring was continued, after which, 0.04 g, 0.08 g, 0.12 g and 0.20 g of GO were added to the four different containers with 5 ml of ethanol and 5 ml of deionized water, and ultrasonically stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained. These four solutions with different GO ratios were added to the titanium (IV) isopropoxide solutions dropwise. These four solutions with different ratios were refluxed at 80 °C for 2 h, after which 17 ml of NaOH (10 mol L−1) was added to each solution and stirring was continued for a 1 h. The four different solutions were placed in separate 100 ml Teflon containers and transferred to sealed stainless steel autoclaves for hydrothermal treatment. The product obtained after 20 h of hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C was filtered by washing with water and ethanol, and then dried at 80 °C for 3 h. For comparison, pure TiO2 nanoparticles were generated using the same method, with the sole difference being that titanium (IV) isopropoxide was used on its own without the addition of GO. The GO reduced throughout the hydrothermal process and transformed into RGO, and nanocomposites doped with 0.04, 0.08, 0.12 and 0.20 g of RGO were produced. The nanocomposites doped with 0.04, 0.08, 0.12 and 0.20 g of RGO were named TRGO-1, TRGO-2, TRGO-3, and TRGO-4, respectively. XRD analyses of the materials produced were carried out via Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation using a Bruker D 8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. In addition, a Raman analysis was made of the patterns involving 514 nm argon-ion laser excitation using a Renishaw Raman system. In addition, the surface properties were examined using an FEI Quanta 650 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). 2.2 Preparing TiO2 and RGO-TiO2 paste A 0.01 g sample each of pure TiO2, TRGO-1, TRGO-2, TRGO-3, and TRGO-4 was taken and placed in separate containers, and 17.5 μl of deionized water, 1 μl of glacial acetic acid, 0.4 μl of Triton X-100 and 0.0041 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG) were added to each container and stirred. Stirring was continued until the mixture acquired a paste stiffness. The paste that formed was coated onto FTO glasses using the doctor blade method [12] to a surface area of 0.25 cm2. The coated films were dried at 120 °C for 30 min, producing five different photoanodes. 2.3 CdS quantum dots coating of the photoanodes Quantum dots were coated to the photoanode surfaces using the SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction) [13] method. First, 0.5 M cadmium nitrate, to be used as a cation source, was dissolved in 30 ml of ethanol, and 0.5 M Na2S, the anion source, was dissolved in deionized water. A total of five different photoanodes produced on FTO were first dipped into a cadmium nitrate solution for 2 min. After removal from the cadmium nitrate solution and washing with ethanol, they were dipped in a Na2S solution for 2 min, after which they were washed with ethanol one more time and dried at 150 °C for 10 min. The photoanodes were then kept at 400 °C in an oven for 1 h. 2.4 Fabrication of QDSSCs A polysulfide redox electrolyte, obtained by dissolving 1 M Na2S and 1 M sulfur in deionized water, was filled between the photoanode coated with CdS quantum dots and the Pt counter electrode to produce the QDSSCs.

Dimethyl Acetamide (DMAC)was purchased from Acros Organics (USA). 1,2,3,4 butane tetra carboxylic acid (BTCA) as cross linker was obtained from MerckGermany (purity >. 99). Titanium tetra isopropoxide and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Humic acid (HA) was obtained from Loba Company. 2.2 Preparation of nanorods TiO2 The hydrothermal technique in aqueous solution was used to make titanate nanorods. In a typical synthesis, 5 mL titanium tetra isopropoxide was dissolved completely in 100 mL deionized water after 3 h of stirring. Drop by drop, 0.2 mL NaOH was added to this solution and stirred for 30 min until a white precipitate appeared. The pH level was kept at 7. Finally, the mixture was transported to a stainless steel autoclave lined with Teflon and heated to 180 °C for 24 h. The precipitate was centrifuged many times with distilled water and ethanol before being dried at 80 °C for 3 h. The dry sample was annealed for 5 h at 400°Celsius. 2.3 Preparation of PVA-CA-Nano TiO2 membranes The immersion phase inversion approach was used to fabricate nanocomposite membranes. After dispersing the NPs in DMAC, these were sonicated for 1 h at 50 kHz. The polymeric solutions were then made with cellulose acetate as the basis polymer and 24 wt% and 4 % PVA, respectively, including various nanomaterials as shown in Table 1a . In the polymeric solution, NPs were added. To make a homogenous casting solution, the mixture was agitated for 12 h. To remove air bubbles from the polymer solution, it was kept in an incubator overnight. The solutions were cast in nonwoven polyester with a thickness of 200 mm using a membrane casting machine, then the polymeric sheets were immediately cured to generate a wet solid membrane. The wet membranes were kept in deionized water. 2.4 Characterization techniques The XRD spectrum (Brukurd 8 advance, CuK, target with secondary monochromator = 40, mA = 40, Germany) was used to determine the XRD patterns for powder samples at ambient temperature using an X-ray generator (Shimadzu, Japan). 2.5 Viscosity measurement The viscosity of the studied polymeric solutions was measured using BROOKFIELD AMETEK DV2T viscometer using spindle entry code No. 27.

The experiment was conducted with H5KS universal tensile testing equipment at a pace of 50 mm min−1. A micrometer was used to measure the thickness of the samples with an accuracy of 0.01 mm. 2.6.2 Scanning electron microscope and the porosity Scanning electron microscope (QUANTA FEG250) was used to determine the morphology of the fabricated membranes. The membrane porosity (ε) was calculated according to gravimetric method as shown in equation (1) (1) ε % = W w - w d ALP H 100 where Ww and Wd are the mass of wet and dry membranes (gm), respectively. The water density is PH and equal 0.998 g/cm3, A and L are the membrane area (m2) and thickness (m) respectively. 2.6.3 Water flux and salt separation Pure water was used to test membrane permeability in a dead-end mode setup with an effective membrane filtration area of 192 cm2 under pressure of 25–40 bars for 2 h. After that, water flux was calculated as follows [35]: (2) Flux ( L m 2 . h - 1 ) = Q AT Q, A, and T represented quantity of permeate (L), membrane area (m2), and sampling time (h), respectively. Salt separation efficiency was obtained using Eq. (3): (3) R e m o v l % = 1 - C P C F 100 Salty water concentration (mgL−1) in feed and permeate are represented by CF and CP, respectively. A conductivity meter was used to determine these values (4510 conductivity meter - JEN WAY).", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "TiO2 nanorods", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "titanium tetra isopropoxide", "amount": "5 mL"}, "prc2": {"name": "NaOH", "amount": "0.2 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "100 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent": "NaOH", "ph": "7"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "180 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "3 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "400 °C", "time": "5 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "PVA-CA-Nano TiO2 membranes", "Syns_method": "immersion phase inversion", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Cellulose acetate", "amount": "base polymer"}, "prc2": {"name": "PVA", "amount": "24 wt%"}, "prc3": {"name": "PVA", "amount": "4 wt%"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "sonicate", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "agitate", "parameters": {"time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "incubate", "parameters": {"time": "overnight"}}}}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "The performance of batteries in electrified powertrain systems is highly influenced by mass diffusion and electrochemistry which are often ignored in the simulation of these systems due to the lack of a conserved, efficient, and integrable battery model. Therefore, this work numerically implements an electrochemical-thermal battery model with conserved numerical schemes and efficient numerical methods which include Jacobian-based and Jacobian-Free Newton Krylov (JFNK) solvers. The performance of the developed model is evaluated by simulating measurements of a LiFePO 4 battery under constant discharge rates and Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), as well as by a detailed comparison with existing battery models. The comparison highlights two features of our model: (a) negligible mass imbalances in the spherical diffusion modelling, which are five orders of magnitude smaller than those from a recent battery model in the literature; (b) efficient modelling of real-world driving cycles with the computational time two orders of magnitude shorter than that of the literature model. These advanced features indicate that our model can be applied in both fundamental electrochemical-thermal studies of lithium-ion battery and detailed simulations of electrified powertrains as an accurate and efficient sub-model.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "LiFePO4", "application": "battery in electrified powertrain systems", "props": {}}}}

Then, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 2.42 mmol, 99%) was slowly added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After that, excess tetrachlorobenzoquinone (1.6 mmol, 98%) was added, and the solution was stirred for another 1 h in the air at room temperature before being neutralized by triethylamine (2.43 mmol, 99.5%). The intermediate product was purified by thin layer chromatography and then re-dissolved in DCM under nitrogen protection. TFA and water solution with a molar ratio of 9:1 was added, and the mixture was stirred in dark for 1 h at room temperature. 100 mL water was added to dilute the acidity of solution, followed by being neutralized with ammonia (AR, 25.0%−28.0%) to pH 7. The mixture was extracted with DCM, dried, and purified with silica gel column to obtain the free-base porphyrin (compound 3a). Compound 3a (0.01 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture solvent containing 9 mL tetrahydrofuran (THF, ≥99.5%) and 9 mL glacial acetic acid (HAc, ≥99.5%). Then, excess cyanoacetic acid (0.41 mmol, 98%), ammonium acetate (1 mmol, ≥99.0%) and zinc acetate (0.36 mmol, 99.99%) were added. The mixture was refluxed at 68 °C for 6 h under nitrogen protection.

In brief, 12.5 mL tetrabutyl titanate (≥99.0%) was diluted using 100 mL isopropanol (IPA, ≥99.5%) in a round-bottom flask, and 5 mL water was slowly added to form a colloidal suspension. The suspension was kept under stirring at room temperature for 8 h, after which the gel was gained by filtration. After being washed with water and then ethanol (99.5%) for 3 times, the cleaned samples were placed in a vacuum drying oven setting at 80 °C for 6 h. The dried precursors were then put into a muffle furnace and calcined at 450 °C for 5 h to obtain TiO2 crystals. To make the composite catalyst Cb-Ph-ZnP/TiO2 , 100 mg TiO2 nanoparticles were firstly suspended in 20 mL DCM, and 0.5 mg Cb-Ph-ZnP in 10 mL DCM was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at room temperature in dark for 24 h. Then, the raw composite catalyst was collected by centrifugation and washing with ethanol for 3 times. Finally, the paste was placed in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the product. Synthesis of TPA-BiPh-ZnP/TiO2 photocatalyst follows the same procedure as Cb-Ph-ZnP/TiO2 . 2.3 Theoretical calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used the Gaussian 09 program package at the B3LYP/6–31G level of theory [36,37]. The LANL2DZ basis set was used for zinc atom and 6–31G basis set for the other atoms. 2.4 Material characterization The morphology of the two photocatalysts was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an Escalab 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with Al Kα radiation source (1486.68 eV energy). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured by UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600Plus, SHIMADZU) referring to BaSO4. 2.5 Photo-electrochemical impedance measurements Photo-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (China) equipped with a xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300D). The standard three-electrode setup were employed, where platinum wire was used as the counter electrode and saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was 5 mM Fe(CN)6 3-/4- (99.7%) in 0.1 M KCl solution. EIS spectra were recorded at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a frequency range of 105–10 Hz and the experimental data was simulated using Z-view software. To prepare the working electrode, a catalyst ink was prepared as follows. A mixture of 5 mg photocatalyst powder, 200 μL ethanol and 20 μL Nafion solution (5%) was ultrasonicated for 10 min to form a uniform suspension. Pick 20 μL of the suspension, and drop it onto a piece of indium tin oxide glass with an area of 0.5 × 1 cm2. The working electrode was obtained after heating the photocatalyst by a tungsten lamp. 2.6 Photodegradation measurements Photodegradation measurements of AB1 (Amido black 10B, Aladdin, ≥98%, 10 ppm in water) were performed on a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm long-pass filter. 5 mg the prepared photocatalyst was added to 50 mL AB1 solution under stirring. The suspension was firstly kept in dark for 1 h to ensure an adsorption/desorption equilibrium on the TiO2 nanoparticles. Then, the suspension was illuminated and 4 mL of the suspension was grabbed from the reaction beaker at an interval of 15 min. The sample mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was used for checking the UV-vis absorbance at 620 nm to find the change of AB1 concentration of the mother solution. Trapping experiments were performed by adding triethanolamine (TEOA, 0.2 mM), 1,4-Benzoquinone (BQ, 0.1 mM) or tert-butanol (TBA, 0.2 mM) as scavengers to the as-prepared suspensions.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Electroanalytical techniques can be useful to provide information on mechanisms and physical processes beyond what we can learn from standard charge/discharge voltage curves. For example, we looked at work in the Cathode reaction scheme section where CV was modeled as a means to propose reaction pathways.20,22 There might be other ways to disaggregate physical processes from each other. For example GITT is commonly used to find diffusion parameters in lithium-ion systems but has only been used experimentally in lithium–sulfur systems to look at internal resistance76 and thermodynamic equilibrium.33,77,78 There has been work done to apply diffusive concepts from GITT theory to a lithium–sulfur cell using a simplified example system79 but no lithium–sulfur continuum model has been applied to understand thermodynamics separately from transport and kinetic processes. However, PITT has been simulated by Danner & Latz31 (more detail in Precipitation section) to explore nucleation overpotential.\nAnother useful electroanalytical measurement is EIS, which can separate processes occurring on different time scales. For lithium–sulfur cells, EIS measurements are commonly fitted to equivalent circuit models and circuit elements that represent physical processes, such as charge transfer resistance, are quantitatively compared. For example, Lee et al.80 compared the magnitude of the charge transfer resistance of a cell with and without a coated separator to suppress shuttling. There have been detailed studies81–83 using equivalent circuits to fit to EIS measurements at different SOCs, states-of-health (SOHs), and temperatures, but it remains challenging to elucidate the origins of each feature (e.g. multiple semi-circles). Physics-based models can help improve diagnostics by attributing specific features to physical processes compared to degenerate equivalent circuit models. Fronczek and Bessler84 are the only authors that have demonstrated the use of full physics-based continuum models to simulate impedance of LiS cells. They use a similar set of governing equations and reaction schemes to Kumaresan8 except that the kinetic reactions are written as elementary steps following Arrhenius law instead of Butler–Volmer expressions.(31)(32) where ṡi is the rate of reaction i, v are stoichiometric coefficients, k are forward and reverse rate constants, aj are activities of species j, Eact is activation energy, z is number of electrons transferred, and Δϕ is the potential difference between solid and electrolyte. They also included an electrochemical double layer which is important for fast timescales. Fronczek and Bessler simulated the impedance using a voltage step of 1 mV in 0.1 microsecond, and took the fast Fourier transform of the current relaxation over 1000 s. They showed the ability to simulate EIS spectra but with very limited discussion on the results. Their simulated impedance also decreased in magnitude with SOC which does not agree with the experimental literature listed above. This disconnect might be due to the parameters used in their model, the concentration dependent ionic conductivity highlighted by Zhang et al.,34 or other missing mechanisms in the model.\nThe field can greatly benefit from using a variety of electroanalytical techniques to validate a model to uncover underlying physics that dominate behavior and cell performance. There is also opportunity for the above continuum models to be applied to electroanalytical methods and explore how they are analyzed as functions of state of the cell such as SOCs.\n", "output": {}}

In brief, 1 mmol MnSO4·H2O and 10 mmol NH4HCO3 were separately dissolved in 70 mL distilled water. Then, 7 mL ethanol and NH4HCO3 solution were added to MnSO4·H2O solution in sequence under stirring. The mixed solution gradually became cloudy with milky-white color, indicative of initial formation of MnCO3, which was kept under stirring for 1 h at room temperature and then centrifuged, washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times. The as-obtained MnCO3 microspheres were freeze-dried for subsequent use. The porous MnO2 microspheres were acquired by sintering MnCO3 microspheres at 400 °C for 5 h in air with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. To obtain Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (MNC) semi-hollow microspheres, 12.5 mmol MnO2 microspheres, 3 mmol Ni (Ac)2·4H2O, 3 mmol Co(Ac)2·4H2O, 29 mmol LiOH·H2O were ultrasonic dispersed in 15 mL ethanol. The ethanol was evaporated slowly at room temperature under stirring. The resultant mixture was ground manually for 20 min and then was calcined at 800 °C for 20 h in air.\n2.2 Surface Treatment and Graphene/Carbon Nanotubes (GCNT) Coating of MNC\nFor surface treatment (ST), the MNC was modified using the completely ionized solution with lithium and cobalt sources. First, 0.3 mmol LiAc and 0.35 mmol Co (Ac)2·4H2O were dissolved in 25 mL ethanol. Next, 175 mg as-synthesized MNC was added into the above solution. The mixed solution was vigorously stirred at 70 °C until the ethanol completely evaporated. The mixture was ground to fine powder and finally calcined at 800 °C for 4 h in air to obtain ST-MNC.\n10 mL graphene oxides/carbon nanotubes (1 mg mL−1 GOCNT) dispersion was dropwise added into 30 mL ST-MNC (5 mg mL−1) dispersion under ultrasonic and magnetic stirring for coating GOCNT onto the ST-MNC surface. Next, chemical treatment of the above dispersion was conducted with a typical condition of 0.1 wt% hydrazine solution for 1 h in 95 °C oil-bath followed by washing with deionized water. After freeze drying, the resulting product was annealed at 400 °C for 2 h to obtain GCNT@ST-MNC. The mass ratio of GCNT for GCNT@ST-MNC was about 4%.\n2.3 Characterization\nThe morphologies of the samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Ultra 55) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2100F, operating at 200 kV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using an X’PertPRO (PANalytical) diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with the monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). Raman characterization was performed with a Raman spectrometer (XploRA, HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with a green excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under air flow with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min−1.

Next, the slurry was coated onto Al foil and dried overnight at 90 °C in vacuum with the loading mass of 1.3 mg cm−2. The half-cell tests were performed using a CR2016 coin-type cell with Li metal as the counter and reference electrode, assembled in an Ar-filled glove box. The separator was a microporous polypropylene membrane (Celgard 2500). The electrolyte was 1 mol L−1 LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (1:1, V/V). Galvanostatic charge/discharge, rate performance and cycling stability were recorded on a battery test instrument (LAND CT2001A) in voltage range of 2.5–4.8 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out with an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E). Here, 1 C current corresponds to 377 mA g−1 based on the cathode mass.\n2.5 Electrochemical Measurements of Full Cell for GCNT@ST-MNC Cathode and Graphite Anode\nThe fabrication of nanographite anode was the same as that of the cathode, and the anode was pre-lithiated prior to use. The detailed process is described as follows: nanographite electrode was assembled with Li counter electrode in coin cell in order to make it lithiated in 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte. The cell was charged from the open circuit potential to 0.01 V (vs. Li/Li+) and then discharged to 1.0 V to complete one cycle. For nanographite lithiation, the cell was again charged to 0.01 V (vs. Li/Li+). After completing lithiation, the nanographite electrode was recovered by disassembling the coin cell. The GCNT@ST-MNC cathode and pre-lithiated nanographite anode were assembled in CR2016 coin cell with an N/P ratio of 1.2.

The CuBTC crystals were washed with 3 × 10 mL of water and 3 × 10 mL of EtOH using solvent exchange. The finished product was heated at 80 °C for 12 h. 2.1.2 Preparation of CuBTC-NH2/CuBTC-NH2-I3 A solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.4 mg), benzene tricarboxylic acid (0.1 mg), and 5-aminoisophthalic acid (0.1 mg) /5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid (0.1 mg) in 15 mL of 1:1 mixture of EtOH and water was heated at 80 °C for 12 h. The CuBTC-NH2/CuBTC-NH2-I3 crystals were washed through solvent exchange using 3 × 10 mL of water and 3 × 10 mL of EtOH. The final product was heated at 80 °C for 12 h (denoted as CuBTC-NH2 and CuBTC-NH2-I3). 2.1.3 Preparation of solid-state electrolytes Typically, 1 g of PVDF-HFP and 0.125 g of LiTFSI were dispersed in 20 ml of NMP to form a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, 1 g of CuBTC, CuBTC-NH2 and CuBTC-NH2-I3 with the same mass were added, respectively. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the homogeneous solution was cast onto the polytetrafluoroethylene mold. After the solvent was evaporated, the film was further dried under vacuum at 60 °C. The resulting polymer electrolyte, designated CuBTC-PVDF, CuBTC-NH2-PVDF and CuBTC-NH2-I3-PVDF, could be peeled off as a self-standing membrane. 2.2 Characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed using a diffractometer (D8-Discover, Bruker Co., USA) with a Cu-Kα X-ray radiation source (λ = 0.154056 nm). The Raman spectroscopy was employed on a Renishaw Invia Raman spectrometer under a backscattering geometry (532 nm) to characterize the CuBTC-PVDF, CuBTC-NH2-PVDF and CuBTC-NH2-I3-PVDF electrolytes. The general morphology and microstructure were exaimed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) (Quanta-450-FEG, FEI Co., U.K.) with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements were obtained using Nicolet 6700 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., USA). IR spectrometer covering 400 to 4000 cm−1 wavenumber range. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out by ESCALAB 250 Xi spectrometer (VG Scientific Co., UK), and all the binding energies obtained in XPS spectra were calibrated using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV. The cycled Li metal anode were transferred into a glovebox with a sealed Ar-filled vessel for SEM and XPS analyses. 2.3 Assembly of solid-state batteries The prepared CuBTC-PVDF, CuBTC-NH2-PVDF and CuBTC-NH2-I3-PVDF membranes were cut into discs with 19 mm diameter and placed in an argon atmosphere filled glove box. Before use, PVDF powder was vacuum-dried overnight at 100 °C to eliminate moisture. Commercial LiFePO4, super-P and PVDF were mixed in NMP with a mass ratio of 8:1:1 to obtain the cathode mixture. The slurry was then bladed on Al foil to produce uniform coating, which was further dried in a vacuum oven with a mass loading of at least 5 mg cm−1 at 100 °C for at least 48 h. Polypropylene (PP) was substituted with various solid electrolyte membranes (thickness of ∼ 50 μm) as the separator. CR2025-type coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box with O2 and H2O levels less than 0.01 ppm. To test cycle performance, the LFP//Li full cells were assembled. The Li//Li and Li//Cu cells were assembled to evaluate the Li deposition performance. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements Ionic conductivity was determined by EIS after placing the solid electrolyte between two electrodes (stainless steel) contacts in a CR2025 coin cell. CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China) was used for measurements at various temperatures from 25 to 80 °C with a step size of 10 °C and frequency ranges from 106 to 0.1 Hz. The bulk resistance of the samples was calculated from the EIS curve. The ionic conductivity was calculated according to the following equation (1): (1) σ = d S R b where d(cm) was the thickness of the solid electrolyte, R b(Ω) and S(cm2) represented the bulk resistance and the effective area of the solid electrolyte, respectively, and σ was the ionic conductivity (S cm−1).

The lithium|solid electrolyte|stainless steel cell was scanned from 0 to 6 V with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 at 25 °C. The lithium transference number (tLi +) was obtained by using AC impedance and DC potentiostatic polarization measurements with Li//Li symmetric cell. A DC potential (ΔV = 10 mV) was applied for 5000 s to gain the initial and steady currents. Meanwhile, the AC impedance spectra of the same cell were measured before and after polarization. The value of tLi + was calculated by equation (3): (3) t Li + = I s ( Δ V - I 0 R 0 ) I 0 ( Δ V - I S R S ) Where R 0 and R s are the AC impedances before and after polarization, respectively. I 0 and Is are the initial and steady currents respectively. The galvanostatic discharge–charge performances of the cells were evaluated on a Neware battery test system at room temperature. To stabilize the SEI, the Li-Cu half cells were operated for the first three cycles at 0.01–1.0 V at 0.05 mA cm−2. Subsequently, lithium was deposited onto a Cu foil for 10 h.

During the calculation process, the Perdew-Berke-Ernzerhof (PBE) method in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was adopted to calculated binding energy. The binding energy (Eb) between solvent/anion and cation was defined as follows (4): (4) E b = E total - E Li - E s Etotal is the total energy of SEI component with coordinated Li, ELi is the single-point energy of Li, Es is the single-point energy of SEI component. 2.5.2 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations The diffusion coefficients and radial distribution functions of Li+ and TFSI- in CuBTC, CuBTC-NH2, and CuBTC-NH2-I3 frameworks were calculated using AIMD. A 1 × 1 × 1 k-dot network was employed with a truncation energy of 520 eV and the time step was set to 2 ps. The modeled samples were assigned an initial temperature of 298 K and then equilibrated using Nose-Hoover for 1 ps in the (NVT) coefficient.

Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as porous crystalline adsorbents for the removal of heavy metal ions.

However, the coordination bonds in CD-based MOFs can be destroyed by water, which limits their application as absorbent materials for the removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater. In this work, a β-CD-MOF-based porous hydrogel was developed by incorporating a crosslinked hydrogel network based on acrylic acid (AA) and N,N’-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBA) monomers into a β-CD-based MOF structure. The synthesized porous hydrogel, denoted A/M−CDMOF−gel, not only showed enhanced structural stability but also exhibited excellent properties for simultaneous adsorption of Au3+, Ag+, and Pb2+ ions. A kinetic study revealed that the A/M−CDMOF−gel had a satisfactory binding rate within 60 min of contact, and the higher fit coefficient from the pseudo-second-order model indicated its chemical adsorption property.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Synthesis\nThe chemical compounds, dimensions and morphologies of MOFs are the crucial influences on their photocatalytic performance. Therefore, researchers have been developing efficient routes for the synthesis of MOFs. Finding a suitable method to fabricate Re-MOFs catalysts has been a challenging topic due to the aggregation of rare earth metal atoms during the synthesis process which prevents their deposition on the carrier surface. In addition, the convenient binding between rare earth elements and oxygen has made preparation of Re-MOFs even more difficult. Hydrothermal, solvothermal reaction, solid-phase method and in situ synthesis method have been used for the efficient synthesis of MOFs and Re-MOFs. Hydrothermal was carried out by placing the reactant solution to high temperature and high pressure in an autoclave, which was an easily controllable and effective method. The steps of the solvothermal method were essentially the same as those of the hydrothermal method. Solid-phase synthesis was a widely used method, which was completely mixed by mechanical and physical mixing without other additives. For in situ synthesis method, the reinforcing material was to be nucleated within the metal matrix. Thus, various approaches have been developed for the preparation of MOFs as well as Re-MOFs materials, as summarized below.\n2.1 Synthesis of MOFs\nThe composition or morphology of the raw materials for the synthesis of MOFs acts as a critical factor for the performance of the ultimate products. In addition, a variety of approaches have been employed to enhance the catalytic properties of MOFs, such as metal ion doping in MOFs, attaching metal oxides, and sulfides and phosphates to MOFs. Numerous approaches, including the hydrothermal method, solvothermal method, vapor-phase transformation method, and wet chemical method, have been applied for the facile synthesis of MOFs in the last few years. In this subsection, some of these methods will be presented.\nOne of the most common methods for synthesizing nanomaterials is the hydrothermal method, which is carried out by subjecting a solution of reactants to an autoclave at high temperature and pressure. This reaction usually yields well-dispersed and highly crystalline products. Hydrothermal reaction is an easy-to-control and efficient method to synthesize MOFs. Zhu and co-workers [35] developed to synthesize NH2-Materials of Institut Lavoisier (MIL)-53(Al)/F-TiO2(B) S-scheme nanohybrids with two-dimensional (2D) F-doped TiO2(B) nanosheets in situ grown on the surface of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical cog wheel-shaped NH2-MIL-53(Al) through a mild hydrothermal method for tetracycline degradation. NH2-MIL-53(Al) exhibits a smooth-faced hierarchical 3D cog wheel shape with a radius of about 2.5 μm. The irregular 2D layered TiO2(B) consists of many edge-exposed nanosheets, whereas the layered thickness of F-TiO2(B) decreases slightly as the incorporation of F species into TiO2(B). In the NH2-MIL-53(Al)/F-TiO2(B) composites, some ultrathin F-TiO2(B) nanosheets are firmly attached on the gear-shaped NH2-MIL-53(Al), which is favorable for inducing interfacial interactions with spatial electron–hole separation.\nThe synthesis of MOFs is generally carried out by solvothermal method. The steps of the solvothermal method are essentially the same as those of the hydrothermal method. While the hydrothermal method involves chemical reactions in a solution above the boiling point of water, the solvothermal method uses a non-aqueous liquid as a solvent at a relatively high temperature. Duan et al. prepared Cu-MOFs materials to capture CO2 and reduce it to CH4 as shown in Fig. 2 [36]. The Cu2O quantum dots were uniformly distributed on the Cu-MOFs. The Cu-2,3,6,7,10,11-Hexahydroxytriphenylene (CuHHTP) prepared by solvothermal method was electrochemically treated to retain the main skeleton of it, and about 33% of the CuO4 nodes were reduced to Cu2O with an average size of 3.5 nm. Characterizations indicated that only the (111) lattice plane of Cu2O existed in Cu2O@CuHHTP due to the uniform distribution of CuO4 nodes in the CuHHTP crystal. Meanwhile, the high exposed (111) single crystal lattice can improve the selectivity of Cu2O to CH4. The prepared Cu2O@HTTP materials exhibit better performance than previous materials in the reduction of CO2. Fang and co-workers [37] synthesized molybdenum disulfide-UiO-66-NH2 MOFs (CMOFs) (a composite membrane with a loosely layered structure) for the degradation of antibiotic contaminants in water using an electrostatic layer-by-layer self-assembly method. The multi-layered MoS2 nanosheet was synthesized via a solvent exfoliation method with slight modifications, and UiO-66-NH2 nanocrystals were synthesized according to traditional solvothermal method. The MoS2/CMOFs composite membrane was prepared via a vacuum-assisted layer-by-layer (LBL) method. And it is hypothesized that the material is used to remove antibiotic contaminants from water through sieving effect, electrostatic adsorption, repulsion, and interaction between pro- and anti-hydrophobic water. Zhu et al. [38] constructed heterojunctions by combining NH2-MIL-125(Ti) with flower-like ZnIn2S4 using a one-pot solvothermal method. The pristine NH2-MIL-125(Ti) possesses irregular round pie shapes with the radius of 150–250 nm, and sphere-like ZnIn2S4 is composed of numerous edge-exposing nanosheets. When ZnIn2S4 combined with NH2-MIL-125(Ti), the surface of NH2-MIL-125(Ti)@Znln2S4 composites become more diffuse and rougher. The amino-functionalized NH2-MIL-125(Ti) modified flower-like ZnIn2S4 were fabricated to form a 3D heterostructure for the photodegradation of toxic contaminants.\nFig. 2\nReproduced with permission from Ref.

The nanorod-like Ni-MOFs array was wrapped with ~ 9 nm Ni2P particles in the Ni-MOF/Ni2P@EG hybrid which displayed a powerful activity and high stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media.\nWang et al. [40] prepared MOF-derived N-doped ZnO carbon skeletons at layered Bi2MoO6 heterojunctions and characterized the materials in detail, considering the application of ZnO as well as bismuth-based catalysts in environmental remediation, as shown in Fig. 3. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was synthesized by a simple wet chemical method, while it was transformed into N-ZnO/C nanoparticles in situ by high temperature calcination (300–550 °C), maintaining a rhombic dodecahedral structure. Finally, the layered Bi2MoO6 nanosheets were in situ grown on the surface of N-ZnO/C to form N-ZnO/C@BiM S-scheme heterojunction with a unique hierarchical core–shell structure via solvothermal method, which confirmed that there were high-energy nucleation sites suitable for growing Bi2MoO6 crystal nuclei on the surface of N-ZnO/C rhombic dodecahedron. Meanwhile, N-ZnO/C@BiM S-scheme heterojunction with 3D layered structure can provide abundant active sites for adsorption and photocatalytic reactions.\nFig. 3\nReproduced with permission from Ref.

These organic molecules usually contain carboxylates, phosphonates and pyridyl functional groups. The bonding energies between metal ions and organic molecules are intermediate, which enable the development and dissolution of reversible bonds during the synthesis of MOFs. MOFs exhibit large pore size, great surface area, large porosity, and low density. Furthermore, numerous organic ligands with great photo-absorption coefficients are available as antennas to sensitize the light-emitting metal centers in the system. Principally, rare earth ions have the possibility to be doped directly into the main body of the MOFs, either as objects (rare earth absorbing MOFs), as dopants (rare earth doped MOFs), or as metallic nodes (rare earth based MOF). In recent years, modifying of metal nodes in MOFs employing rare earth metals as modifiers or substitutes has gained a lot of interests. Exploring suitable approaches for the fabrication of Re-MOFs is proved to be a hot research topic, and some of the fabrication methods are discussed in this subsection.\n2.2.1 Hydrothermal method\nThe main difference between hydrothermal method and other types of wet chemical synthesis is the temperature and pressure. The synthesis temperature of hydrothermal method is usually in the range of 130–250 °C. The greatest advantage of the hydrothermal method is that the crystalline powder obtained directly without particularly high temperatures, avoiding the possible formation of hard agglomerates of particles, and eliminating impurities due to grinding and other operations. Meanwhile, the hydrothermal method can change the crystal structure and crystalline form of the catalyst by changing the reaction conditions [41].\nZhao and co-workers [42] synthesized highly stable chain-like fluorescence MOFs composed of Eu nodes and 5-bromoisophthalic acid (H2BIPA) based ligand, formulated as [Eu2(BIPA)3(H2O)], which was constructed using a simple one-step hydrothermal method heated at 150 °C for 72 h and then applied to simultaneously detect and remove tetracycline (TC) residues. The 2D layered structure was formed based on the interconnection between two Eu chains with H2BIPA ligands. In addition, the adjacent layers were supported by H2BIPA ligands bound to Eu ions, forming a 3D porous framework. In Eu-MOFs, Eu3+ reacts with the carboxylate group of H2BIPA to form MOFs, which prevents the coordination of water molecules and significantly enhances the fluorescence intensity of Eu-TC. Li et al. [43] synthesized bimetallic CeCo-MOFs by a one-step hydrothermal method heated at 80 °C for 24 h using Ce(NO3)3-6H2O, (CH3COO)2Co-4H2O and terephthalic acid CeCo-MOFs retained its rectangular shape after oxidized calcination, but its surface and edges were fractured, indicating that the oxidized treatment was successful. The one-step hydrothermal synthesis of bimetallic CeCo-MOFs was treated with phosphate, resulting in the formation of close contact S-scheme CeO/CoP heterojunctions. Eosin Y (EY) adsorbed on the catalyst surface forms the excited state EY1* under visible light irradiation, and then EY1* is converted to EY3* by intersystemic conversion. The separation of electrons and inter-catalyst transfer was accelerated, thus promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of CeCo/P. Liao et al. [44] previously synthesized Er-MOFs using a hot solvent method heated for 12 h at 200 °C and later compounded MoS2 with Er-MOFs by hydrothermal method. The scale of Er-MOFs was several micrometers. The surface of MoS2 had a large number of folds with less uniform size and morphology, which facilitated the exposure of catalytic active sites. The morphology of Er-MOF/MoS2 was very fragmented and disordered, and had a larger microporous structure than that of Er-MOFs, and these micropores could transport the electrolyte to the catalytic surface, which reduced the adhesion of the gas–solid interface and facilitated the release of the H2 produced on the surface of the catalyst.\n2.2.2 Solvothermal method\nBoth the solvothermal method and the hydrothermal method follow essentially the same procedures. The hydrothermal method conducts the chemical reaction in a liquid solution above the water boiling point, while the solvothermal method utilizes a non-aqueous liquid as the solvent at a relatively low temperature. The solvothermal method is a synthetic method derived from the hydrothermal method, which typically performs the reaction at a lower temperature than hydrothermal and therefore can be operated at a higher pressure, facilitating the crystallization of the products.\nHuang and co-workers [45] prepared two Re-MOFs catalysts, Eu-MOFs and Tb-MOFs, respectively, by a common solvothermal method: by dissolving Eu3+ and Tb3+ with aromatic tetracarboxylic acid H4TPTC in a mixture of solvents dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and CH3CN with HNO3, and then pouring the mixture into a stainless-steel reactor at 80 °C. The catalyst material was synthesized with unique Eu2(COO)4 or Tb2(COO)4 metal clusters. These two types of catalysts have excellent removal rates for the Rhodamine B (RhB). Mohammadnejad and co-workers [46] prepared Er-MOFs using Er(NO3)3-6H2O, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC). The Er(NO3)3-6H2O was reacted with BTC in a mixed solvent of DMF and water at 105 °C for 24 h to give Er(BTC)(H2O)-(DMF)1.1. The compound was activated in vacuum at 330 °C for 4 h to remove residual and ligand solvent molecules. The metal Er ion consists of seven O atoms coordinated to six O atoms of six carboxylic acid groups of six BTC ligands and one oxygen atom of a terminal water molecule to form an aberrant pentagonal bipyramidal coordination sphere, in which four O atoms of four BTC anions and one O atom of a water molecule form the basal plane, while the axial position is occupied by two O atoms from two other BTC molecules. The synthesized Er-MOFs catalyst has relatively high thermal and water stability as well as large specific surface area, which enables it to be used as a photocatalyst for the removal of organic pollutants from water. Nagajyothi et al. [47] also applied a simple solvothermal method to synthesize Ce-MOFs catalyst. Ce-MOFs was synthesized by solvothermal method: cerium nitrate hexahydrate and trimesic acid were dissolved in deionized water and ethanol, and the reaction solution was placed in a hydrothermal apparatus and kept at 180 °C for 12 h. The Ce-MOFs have a rod-like morphology. The prepared Ce-MOFs catalyst exhibited superior photodegradation rates of Methylene Blue (MB) and RhB compared to CeO2 nanoparticles obtained by calcination.\nThe preparation of Re-MOFs catalysts using solvothermal method not only allows the synthesis of binary system catalysts, but also the development of ternary system catalysts in subsequent studies. Liu et al. [48] reported a novel europium-cadmium MOF based on a zwitterionic carboxylate ligand, [EuCd(pbbp)2(SO4)2Cl2(H2O)3] (in which H2pbbp⋅2Cl = 1,1′-(1,4-phenylene-bis(-methylene))-bis(3-carboxy pyridinium) dichloride), has been synthesized by the solvothermal method involving the heterometallic cooperative crystallization method. Eu-Cd-MOFs materials were synthesized by the solvothermal method with H2pbbp⋅2Cl, CdSO4⋅8/3H2O, and Eu(NO3)3⋅6H2O dissolved in a mixture of DMF and methanol. Eu-Cd-MOFs materials were consisted of Eu-Cd heterogeneous metal chains with a one-dimensional channel crystal structure. The Eu-Cd-MOFs compound exhibited high CO2 adsorption, interesting excitation-dependent luminescence, and good photocatalytic degradation activity toward RhB. Wang and co-workers [49] synthesized lanthanide metal–organic skeletons (Y/Yb/Er-MOF) for the detection of humidity in air using a hot solvent method. Y/Yb/Er-MOF was synthesized by the hydrothermal method using LnCl3 (Y3+: Yb3+: Er3+ = 78: 20: 2), BTC, DMF and deionized water added and heated at 150 °C for 12 h. Y/Yb/Er-MOF was in the form of rectangular prisms with an average particle size of about 20 µm. The crystal structure of the BTC-MOF matrix material was unchanged after doping with Yb3+ and Er3+, and the crystal structures of Y/Yb/Er-MOF and Y-BTC-MOF were isostructural, which could be attributed to the tetragonal crystal system, where the lanthanide ions were coordinated to the O atoms in the BTC. The Y/Yb/Er-MOF materials could respond to relative humidity (RH) in the range of 11%–95%.\n2.2.3 Solid-phase synthesis method\nSolid-phase synthesis is also commonly utilized for the fabrication of catalysts. Among these methods, the ball milling method has been frequently applied for the synthesis of catalysts owing to its simplicity of preparation, high production performance, and absence of other solvents or additives, which only required physical mixing or mechanical stirring to fabricate the corresponding materials.\nWei et al. [50] synthesized samarium-based metal–organic frameworks (Sm-MOFs) using terephthalic acid, hydrated samarium acetate, deionized water, and stainless-steel balls via microwave-assisted ball milling. The particle morphology of Sm-MOFs with different structures and good dispersion was mainly due to the weakened or even disappeared intermolecular interactions of organic ligands and the enhanced deprotonation of organic ligands, which promoted the growth of crystals in aqueous solution. The Sm-MOFs catalyst was experimentally confirmed to have good thermal stability and great potential for the removal of Congo red. Cai et al. [51] prepared a Ce-MOF/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction using a solid-phase synthesis method, as shown in Fig. 4. Ce-MOFs were obtained using Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O, BTC and DMF at 100 °C for 17 h. Pure Bi2MoO6 was prepared by a hydrothermal method, and Ce-MOF/Bi2MoO6 composites were obtained under mild conditions. The benzenetricarboxylic acid was applied as the ligand during the synthesis of Ce-centered MOF, and the intense contact between Bi2MoO6 and Ce-MOF via the strong electron-coupled interface boosted photoreduction of CO2 performance.\nFig. 4\nReproduced with permission from Ref. [51]. Copyright 2022, Elsevier\nAn illustration of synthesis route of Ce-MOF/Bi2MoO6 composite.\nFull size image\n2.2.4 In situ synthesis method\nThe in situ synthesis method has been developed in recent years as an approach to fabricate composites. In the composites fabricated by in situ synthesis, the reinforcement will be nucleated within the metal matrix and the surface of the reinforcement will not be contaminated, while the compatibility between the matrix and the reinforcement has been enhanced and the interface bonding has been increased. Meanwhile, this method eliminates the tedious pretreatment stage of other methods for fabricating composites, and the preparation process is straightforward.\nYang and co-workers [52] successfully obtained nanocomposite membranes (Sm-MOFs/GO) composed of samarium metal–organic framework (Sm-MOFs) and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The aqueous-stable Sm-MOFs with in situ growth on GO nanosheets has prevented the adjacent GO layers from expansion in aqueous solution, resulting in stabilized membrane skeleton structure of the as-prepared Sm-MOFs/GO membranes. Moreover, the effective loading of Sm-MOFs expanded the layer spacing of the composite membranes, contributing to the enhancement of the permeability for the composite membranes.\nThe four synthetic methods mentioned above are all common methods for synthesizing Re-MOFs, and all of them can be used to modulate the crystal structure and properties of Re-MOFs by changing the reaction conditions. However, there are obvious differences between these four preparation methods. Firstly, hydrothermal synthesis and solvothermal synthesis require liquid solvents during the preparation process, whereas solid-phase synthesis does not require the addition of solvents, and in situ synthesis is to add the raw materials directly in the reaction system. Hydrothermal synthesis often requires high temperature and high pressure to carry out the reaction, solvothermal reaction conditions are relatively mild, and hydrothermal and solvothermal methods can synthesize complex Re-MOFs faster, while solid-phase synthesis and in situ synthesis require higher temperatures as well as a longer time to realize.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Y/Yb/Er-MOF", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal method", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "YCl3", "amount": "78 parts"}, "prc2": {"name": "YbCl3", "amount": "20 parts"}, "prc3": {"name": "ErCl3", "amount": "2 parts"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "150 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}}}

Herein, we design a solid CPE with dual-interface compatibility based on in-situ thermal polymerization of a precursor solution containing polymer monomer, cesium-ion (Cs+), and inorganic Li+ conductor.

By placing the produced tablet in front of IR light, the resulting spectrum in the range of 4000 to 450 cm−1 was evaluated. SEM images were taken by LEO 1455VP to show the morphology and size of the samples. In this regard, materials were covered with gold to prepare for imaging. To inquire the crystal structure of the synthesized nanomaterials, the Siemens D-5000 XRD diffraction gauge (copper irradiation λ = 1.5406 A °) was utilized.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Principles of flow nanoparticle synthesis The concept of continuous flow synthesis is based on the uninterrupted movement of reactants through a reaction vessel, as opposed to the batch processing approach used in conventional chemical synthesis. During batch processing, reactants are added and mixed sequentially within a reactor for a predetermined time. Flow chemistry involves the mixing and reaction of reactants as they pass through a designated vessel, which results in the production of the desired end product at the outlet. The resulting product may be either stored or subjected to further reaction at a subsequent stage of synthesis [27]. Fig. 1 shows the installation of continuous flow nanoparticle synthesis, which may be altered depending on the specific reaction sequence. For multi-reaction systems, a multi-chain of reaction vessels may be used. In general, a pump is used to transport the reactants or solutions into the chemical flow system. The flow rate can be adjusted according to the reaction. Common types of pumps include piston, peristaltic, syringe, and gear centrifugal pumps. The reactant streams are typically combined in a mixer, such as a T-shaped, Y-shaped, or quad mixer, which is classified by the number of reactant inlets and the direction of flow. The combined reactant streams are directed to a reaction vessel, which provides a residence time for the reaction to occur. Various types of reaction vessels have been developed for different purposes, such as coil, tubular, column, and impingement jet mixing reactors. These reactors are designed for optimal mixing through various mechanisms. If a catalytic reagent is required for the reaction, a column reactor is frequently used. This type of reactor is packed with solid reagents, catalytic agents, or scavengers for flow chemistry. Most chemical reactions necessitate certain environmental conditions to generate the desired product. In such cases, an additional apparatus, such as a back pressure regulator, heater, cooler, oscillator, electrochemistry module, microwave reactor, light source, or ultrasonic generator, can be incorporated into the continuous flow platform to establish the desired reaction conditions. After completion of the reaction, the products are directed to the downstream unit for immediate analysis and subsequent work-up procedures. In-line analytics are frequently employed to monitor and analyze the response to items during production. This enables immediate modifications to the reaction conditions, if necessary, along with the capability of enhancing the reaction to achieve the highest possible yield and purity of the final product [28].", "output": {}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials The source for Fe center, iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9 H2O) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; the glacial acetic acid (100%) required for preparing chitosan solution; and hydrochloric acid (37%) for buffer preparation were purchased from VWR (AnalaR NORMAPUR ACS). The matrix-chitosan (from shrimp shells, ≥75% deacetylated), the organic ligand for MOF trimesic acid (H3BTC, 98%), solvent for MOF synthesis, methanol, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)− 1,3-propanediol (Trizma® base) for buffer preparation were all received from Sigma-Aldrich. Concentrated nitric acid (>65%, used to prepare 5% nitric acid solutions required for Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES)), was purchased from Honeywell Fluka. All chemicals were used as received without further purification and UHQ water was used throughout in synthesis and adsorption experiments, except on the real-life adsorption test conditions, wherein tap water was used. 2.2 Fabrication of MIL-100(Fe) embedded -chitosan adsorbent MIL-100(Fe) was in situ generated in a chitosan matrix by following the methodology reported previously[23]. A chitosan-acetic acid colloidal solution was prepared by dissolving 9 mg/ml chitosan in 2% (v/v) of acetic acid solution. Fe(NO3)3·9 H2O of the desired concentration was introduced to the chitosan solution and stirred continuously until a homogenous chitosan-Fe solution was obtained. For the synthesis of chitosan beads with 2.6 mmol/g of metal content, 10 ml of chitosan colloidal solution was mixed with 0.23 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9 H2O. The metal-complexed chitosan solution was added to 1 M NaOH solution in a dropwise manner. The instantaneously obtained beads were kept in the NaOH bath for 2 h with continuous stirring. The solidified beads were washed with water until the pH of the filtrate was neutral, followed by exchanging the solvent of the hydrogel for methanol, by immersing in a methanol-water solution with successively increasing the methanol concentration. Consequently, these solvogels were treated with a methanol solution of H3BTC under specific solvothermal reaction conditions as given in Table 1. The concentration of H3BTC:Fe was kept 1:1 throughout the reactions. The obtained MOF-chitosan beads were washed with methanol, followed by solvent exchange with water, and freeze-dried at − 50 °C overnight. 2.3 Characterization The powder X-ray diffraction analyses (phase identification and crystallinity properties) of the obtained beads were made using Malvern Panalytical X′Pert PRO MPD powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å generated by sealed X-ray tube and Ni β-filter; 45 kV, 40 mA). Diffraction intensities were recorded in 2θ with the range of 3–50° by an X′Celerator position-sensitive detector. Data processing were carried out by the program X′Pert HighScore Plus (v. 4.9). The search-match phase identifications for the prepared crystalline phases were made in the same program using the simulated PXRD patterns (generated with Mercury program) of the expected reference single crystal structures that were retrieved from the Cambridge structural database (CSD)[26,27]. The chemical environment of the porous adsorbents was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Nicolet iS50, (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in an ATR mode in the range 400–4000 cm−1. The morphology analyses were performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss EVO-50XVP) fitted with an energy-dispersive X-ray detector (EDX, Bruker Quantax 400). To determine Fe concentrations, the adsorbents were subjected to wet acid digestion using con. HNO3 under ultrasound treatment and the obtained sample solution was subsequently analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer Avio 500). To determine the point of zero charge, the pH drift method was used, and for that purpose 50 mg of the adsorbent was introduced to pH adjusted 0.1 M NaNO3 electrolyte. A series of tests were carried out between the initial pH of 3–12, and the final pH were measured at 24 h. 2.4 Arsenic adsorption experiments As3+ and As5+ stock solutions were prepared from As2O3 and Na2HAsO4·7 H2O, respectively. The experimental solutions with desired concentrations were obtained by diluting the stock solutions using buffers of the desired pH. For all the adsorption tests, the MIL-100(Fe)-chitosan bead dosage was fixed as 1 g/L, and proper adsorbent analyte interaction was ensured by shaking the test solution at 280 rpm on a shaker. Adsorption kinetics were determined using 30 ml As3+, and As5+ solutions, and a specific volume of aliquot was collected at regular intervals to determine the concentrations of arsenic species. Isotherm studies were carried out by varying concentrations of As3+, and As5+ from 1 to 100 mg/L. Kinetic studies and isotherm studies were conducted for a contact time of 24 h. The effect of the pH on adsorption was investigated between pH 3–11, and for each test buffers of respective pH were prepared. Na2CO3, Na2SO4, NaNO3, and Na3PO4 were used to test the effects of co-existing anions on arsenic adsorption. For studying the effect of pH and interfering anions, the adsorbent was shaken with arsenic solutions for 5 h. To investigate the reusability of the adsorbent, desorption-regeneration experiments were conducted. Initially, adsorbent was kept in contact with arsenic solutions for 6 h. Then the spent adsorbents were regenerated by soaking with 0.5 M NaHCO3 for 6 h and the regenerated adsorbents were thoroughly washed with water to attain neutral pH and then reused in the next adsorption cycle, the process was repeated five times. Arsenic solutions with an initial concentration of 5 mg/L were used in all adsorption experiments. The concentrations of arsenic in the solutions before and after adsorption were assessed using ICP-OES, for the determination of adsorbed arsenic concentrations. The adsorption tests were conducted in duplicates, yielding results within an acceptable range of ± 5%. The adsorption % and adsorption capacities (qe) were calculated based on Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). (1) adsorption % = C o − C e C o * 100 (2) qe = C o − C e W * V Where Co and Ce (mg/L) are the initial and the equilibrium concentration of the analyte.

Dyes, persisting or decomposing in the environment, enter drinking water through nature's water cycle and can cause severe problems to human health. Researchers have investigated and proposed various wastewater treatment techniques to reduce dyes' emissions, including adsorption, which appears to be the most cost- and time-effective. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are adsorption materials used for many applications for their high specific surface area, pore size, and volume tunability. In dye removal, MOFs are used exceptionally in batch experiments, which hinders their application on an industrial scale. In this review, a comprehensive understanding of the most recent strategies for MOF synthesis is discussed with a focus on effective adsorption of dyes. The most considered interactions between MOFs and dyes are presented with examples and an endeavor is made to understand the contribution of surface charge and size compatibility to adsorption process. Furthermore, the present survey presents the strategies for incorporation of MOF into electrospun nanofiber (ENF) carriers in detail and demonstrates examples of MOF/ENF composite’s effective application towards the adsorption of dye in textile effluents. It is highlighted that dye-MOF interactions are mostly responsible for the dye adsorption process on MOF/ENF.

The effect of graded composition and post-heat treatment on microstructure, phase, nano-mechanical properties, and wear behavior has been investigated in detail. The microstructure analysis shows that there is a reduction in the area fraction of porosities and an improvement in surface roughness in the functionally graded coating. After heat treatment of the coating, the area fraction of porosities and surface roughness reduces, which is due to the sintering effect during post-heat treatment. There is a reduction in the magnitude of residual stress in the functionally graded coating in comparison with HA coating. However, after post-heat treatment, the residual stress magnitude reduces, and nature changes from compressive (as-sprayed condition) to tensile in nature (post-heat-treated condition), which is due to the annealing effect. There is improvement in nano-hardness and Young’s modulus after post-heat treatment of the coating, which is due to the heat treatment leading to densification of microstructure and amorphous to crystalline phase transformation.

The mixture of Cu, Si, and red P in a molar ratio of 1:2:3 was added into the tanks filled with argon. The mass ratio of raw materials to steel balls was 1:25. 3 g powder was ball milled for each run by the planetary mono mill (Fritsch Pulverisette-6) at a speed of 300 rpm for 7 h, with a duration time of 10 mins and a rest time of 5 mins. To obtain a better mechanical alloying, a reverse operation mode (regular reversal of the direction of rotation) was adopted. To prepare the yolk-shell structured CuSi2P3@graphene nanocomposite, graphite was added into the as-prepared CuSi2P3 with a weight ratio of 1:7 (graphite:CuSi2P3) and ball milled at 400 rpm for 20 h. Then the as-synthesized carbon-coated CuSi2P3 was further mixed with additional graphite in a weight ratio of 1:8 and milled at 200 rpm for another 30 mins to produce yolk-shell structured carbon coated CuSi2P3@graphene nanocomposites. Other controlled experiments illustrated in the text were performed in a similar method. 2.2 Material characterization The as-synthesized powder samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE) using CuKα radiation at a scanning speed of 1° min−1 and the Confocal Raman spectrometer (Raman, WTEC ALPHA300 with a 325 nm excitation laser).

The related samples were also characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS Thermo Fisher Escalab 250Xi using Al Kα radiation). 2.3 Electrochemical characterization For the pure phase CuSi2P3, the electrode films were prepared by coating the slurry of 70 wt% CuSi2P3, 20 wt% carbon black and 10 wt% Li-PAA binder onto the copper foil and dried in vacuum oven at 100 °C for overnight. For the CuSi2P3@graphene nanocomposite, the electrode films were prepared by coating the slurry of 90 wt% CuSi2P3@ few layered graphene nanocomposite, and 10 wt% binder onto the copper foil without any extra conducting agents. The electrochemical characterizations were conducted by utilizing CR2032 coin cells assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox (H2O <0.02 ppm, O2 <0.02 ppm, Mbraun, Labmaster 130). Li foils were used as counter and reference electrodes, and 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethylene carbonate (EC/DEC, 1 : 1 vol%) was used as the electrolyte. The loading of the active material on the Cu foil is controlled within the range of 1.5–2 mg cm−2.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis of FeWO4 nanorods The FeWO4 nanorods were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. 1 mmol of FeCl3·6H2O (AR, 99.9%, Macklin) was dissolved in 25 mL deionized water and kept stirring for 30 min. Meanwhile, 1.5 mmol of Na2WO4·2H2O (AR, 99.5%, Macklin) and 100 mg of Hydroxypropyl (HCP) (Macklin) were also dissolved in 25 mL deionized water and kept stirring for 30 min. Then the latter solution was quickly poured into the former one under continuous stirring. After mixing above both solutions, the mixture was stirred for another 30 min. The mixed solution obtained was poured into a 100 mL polytetrafluoroethylene autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 18 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained materials were washed with ethanol and deionized water. Then the FeWO4 nanorods were obtained after the materials dried at 80 °C for 6 h. In addition, the reference sample Fe2O3 was obtained which could be prepared by not adding Na2WO4·2H2O. 2.2 Material characterization The morphologies of the obtained samples were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU8220, HITACHI, Japan) at 10.0 kV and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Bruker AXS, Germany) patterns were collected with Cu-Kα radiation and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250, USA) measurements were taken to analyze the chemical compositions. 2.3 Preparation of Li2S6 solution The 0.5 M Li2S6 solution was prepared by dispersing 1.6 g of sulfur powder (S8), 0.46 g of lithium sulfide (Li2S), and 0.138 g of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in 20 mL of dioxolane/dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME, 1:1, v:v) mixed solution with 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The solution was heated at 60 °C for 1 day under continuous magnetic stirring to form a homogeneous solution. 2.4 LiPSs absorption experiments The 3 mM Li2S6 solution was prepared by dissolving stoichiometric amounts of elemental sulfur (S) and lithium sulfide (Li2S, Alfa Aesar) with a molar ratio of 5:1 in 1, 3-dioxolane and 1, 2-dimethoxyethane (v/v = 1:1) at 60 °C with vigorous stirring in an Ar-filled glovebox (with < 0.1 ppm H2O and O2) for 24 h. In a typical visual LiPS-absorption test, 20 mg of the as-prepared powders of FeWO4 and Fe2O3 was added to 6 mL of the above mentioned Li2S6 solution and soaked for 6 h. After 6 h, 4 mL supernatant was taken out, its residual concentration of Li2S6 was determined by UV–vis spectroscopy. 2.5 LiPSs catalytic characterization The redox current tests were carried out based on the CV measurements of symmetric batteries under a polarization of 1.0 V. The symmetric batteries were first assembled by placing two identical electrodes (FeWO4 or Fe2O3) into a standard 2032 coin battery with Celgard 2400 membrane as the separator and 22.0 μL Li2S6 solution (0.5 mol L-1) as the electrolyte. The CV measurements of symmetric batteries were operated on a CHI660E at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 within a voltage window from −1.0 to 1.0 V. Commercial carbon cloth was punched into small circle disks with a diameter of 12 mm. The FeWO4 or Fe2O3 powder was loaded on a piece of carbon cloth circle disk. Typically, the FeWO4 or Fe2O3 acted as the cathodes and the lithium foil served as the anode. Celgard 2400 membrane as the separator was inserted into the compartment of between cathode and anode. 12 μL Li2S6 catholyte was added into the cathode and 20 μL electrolyte without Li2S6 was dropped onto the anode compartment. The assembled batteries were galvanostatically discharged at 0.1 mA to 2.05 V and then kept potentiostatically at 2.05 V till the current was below 10-5 A. 2.6 Electrochemical measurements The cathode was fabricated by a mixture which contained 80 wt% of functional materials, 10 wt% of conductive carbon, and 10 wt% of poly(vinylidene difluoride) in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent under stirring for 12 h. The slurry was coated onto carbon cloth with a diameter of 12 mm, then vacuum-dried at 120 °C for 24 h (the FeWO4 or Fe2O3 was controlled to be 0.5–0.7 mg cm−2). The Li2S6 loading was 1 mg cm−2 for the electrochemical measurements. The batteries were assembled by using a 1 M LiTFSI with 5% LiNO3 additive as the electrolyte, lithium foil as the anode, and Celgard 2400 as separators in the standard 2032 coin battery. And an average amount of 60 μL electrolyte was added in each battery with carbon paper protection of electrode. Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests were performed on a Neware battery tester with a voltage window of 1.8–2.6 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a temperature of 30 °C. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation with various scan rates and frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz. All specific capacity values were calculated according to the mass of active Li2S6. 2.7 DFT calculations In the present work, the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to obtain adsorption energy ( E ad ) that characterizes the adsorption strength of Li2Sn on the FeWO4 (100) surface, which was defined as: E ad = E FeWO 4 + Li 2 S n - E Li 2 S n - E FeWO4 where E FeWO 4 + Li 2 S n , E Li 2 S n and E FeWO4 , are the total energy of the adsorption system, isolated Li2Sn, and FeWO4 substrate, respectively. The electron–ion interaction was described with projected-augmented-wave method (PAW) [24] and the exchange–correlation interaction functional is the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [25]. The energy cut off of the plane waves was set to 630 eV and the vacuum separation above the FeWO4 surface was set to 20 Å to avoid neighboring images due to periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The underlying structure optimizations were performed using the BFGS algorithm [26], and the convergence criterion was set to 10-5 eV/cell in energy and 0.03 eV/Å in force. The Brillouin zone (BZ) was integrated using a 1 × 1 × 1 k-mesh according to Monkhorst-Pack method during the structure relaxation. According to this definition, a more negative value indicates a more energetically favorable reaction between Li2Sn and substrate.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "FeWO4", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "FeCl3·6H2O", "amount": "1 mmol"}, "prc2": {"name": "Na2WO4·2H2O", "amount": "1.5 mmol"}, "prc3": {"name": "Hydroxypropyl", "amount": "100 mg"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "200 °C", "time": "18 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "6 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Fe2O3", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "FeCl3·6H2O", "amount": "1 mmol"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "25 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "200 °C", "time": "18 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "6 h"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "4 Experimental and numerical studies conducted on BTMS Numerous experimental and numerical studies have been conducted for various types of BTMS which are reported in the literature. Experiments based on the cell level, module level, and pack level are performed to investigate the thermal performance of batteries at different working conditions. Mathematical modeling based on CFD has been reported by many investigators and is briefly presented in this section. Experimental research is the base of any research study to find the co-relations between the dependent variable and the independent variable. It determines the influence of one parameter on another. This section considers the contribution of many investigators in developing the numerical and experimental platform for thermal management of LIBs to investigate the effect of structural and operating parameters on its performance and lifespan. A summary of a few of the studies on BTMS is recorded in the corresponding section of this article (Tables 2–5 ) based on the numerical and experimental results and significant findings of the researchers. 4.1 Air-cooled BTMS Air cooling is the natural method of battery cooling which can be further classified as free and forced convection cooling [9]. The key advantages of these systems are their simplicity, low cost, electrical safety, lightweight, no-leakage concern, easier maintenance, and so on [9,40]. The natural cooling was unable to accomplish the demand of a high temperature working environment, larger battery pack cooling, and high charge-discharge cycles. To overcome these limitations, the forced-air cooling technique is employed along with the addition of exhaust fans [57–63], blowers [61], modified air-flow channels [64–66], fins structure [67,68], etc. Many researchers have studied these additive cooling techniques to improve the cooling effectiveness of battery cells and packs and are addressed in Fig. 5 . Based on the literature, typical experimental and numerical work was conducted on air-cooled BTMS with different additives techniques (Fig. 5) and is presented in the subsequent text along with the summary (Table 2). 4.1.1 Experimental and numerical analysis of air-cooled BTMS The numerical and experimental research studies on air cooling technique are performed by varying the size and shape of the battery pack, arrangement of cells inside it, air-flow channels, location, and the number of air inlets and outlets. 4.1.1.1 Based on modified airflow channels The air cooling technique by changing the airflow patterns for batteries has been vastly studied and investigated by various investigators. Yuanzhi Liu et al. [59] proposed a J-type air-cooled BTMS in which the temperature uniformity can be improved by alternating the mode of operation between U and Z-type structures assisted with two control valves. The optimization results showed that a reduction of 31.18% in the temperature rise is obtained for the J-type structure. An optimal battery pack structure and control strategy under dynamic working conditions can be developed for future research. Kai Chen et al. [70] performed structural optimization of a U-type parallel air-cooled BTMS using a flow resistance network model and found that the cooling efficiency of the system cannot be improved by changing the angles of plenums but optimizing the inlet and outlet widths. After optimization, ΔTmax between the cells is dropped by 70%. A similar study [73] is conducted for a Z-type parallel air-cooled system (Fig. 6 ) by using a flow resistance network model combined with the Newton method and concluded that the proposed optimization technique is a feasible method and less time-consuming than CFD simulation. The ΔTmax between the cells is dropped by 45% and 41% for a fixed inlet flow rate of air and fixed power consumption respectively under constant heat generation after optimization. The configuration optimization [77] of the proposed BTMS [73] is performed and found that Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery pack are reduced by 0.8°C and 42% respectively. Further studies [78] are conducted to optimize the spacing between the cells using CFD simulation and the results showed that the Tmax is reduced by approximately 3°C and the ΔTmax is reduced by more than 60%. The proposed optimization method can be recommended to design cell spacing and to enhance cooling performance. Haobing Zhou et al. [74] proposed a BTMS based on air distribution pipe for thermal analysis of Li-ion battery module under different orifice parameters and discharge rates. The results indicated that the Tmax of the battery module reduced from 52.9°C to 32.7°C and the ΔTmax is below 3°C at 100 Pa inlet pressure, 1.5 mm orifice diameter, 5 rows of the orifice, and 3C discharge rate. The study concluded that an increase in the structural parameters improves thermal performance but also increases power consumption. There are several limitations mentioned in this study that can be eliminated by further investigations. A battery module with confined flow [75] (Fig. 7 ) is designed and compared with regular open flow rectangular modules using forced air cooling. The results inferred that the ΔTmax is less than 0.24°C and Tmax is dropped to 6.19°C compared with the open flow case. Shixue Wang et al. [64] performed experimentation (Fig. 8 ) on a reciprocating air-flow cooling method to improve the thermal characteristics of NCM pouch type LIB by adopting Infrared Imaging (IR) technology at different depth of discharge (DOD) under natural convection and reciprocating air-flow condition. The experiment concluded that for natural convection, the forward airflow performs better than backward air-flow direction and it is advisable to start air-reciprocation at 50% DOD. The proposed method improves temperature distribution positively but has a limited influence on the Tmax of the battery. Xiaoyu Na et al. [65] proposed a reverse-layered air flow BTMS to advance the temperature consistency, Tmax, and ΔTmax of Li-ion batteries and compared it with the unidirectional airflow by 3D CFD simulation and experiment. The results showed that the Tmax, ΔTmax, and Tavg are reduced by 0.5°C, 1.1°C, and 2.7°C respectively. A numerical investigation [76] of the effects of permeability and porosity of Aluminum porous metal foam embedded flow channel of an air-cooled Li-ion battery module is performed. The results indicated that both the Tσ and Tmax inside the battery are reduced with the decrease in the porosity of metal foam. And increasing the permeability of metal foam increases the temperature non-uniformity while decreases the Tmax inside the battery. Sihui Hong et al. [79] performed CFD simulation and mathematical analysis of a secondary vent-based parallel air-cooled system and found that the Tmax and ΔTmax are unaffected by inlet air temperature but strongly affected by the change in location and size of the vent. At constant heat generation, the Tmax and ΔTmax are reduced by 5°C and 60% respectively compared to the original system. Xiongbin Peng et al. [80] experimentally investigated the calorific value and specific heat capacity of an air-cooled LIB pack and the results indicated that with different calorific values, Tmax increases faster and ΔTmax becomes larger. Considering the design point of view, to attain better thermal performance, the inlet and outlet should be kept on the same side of the battery pack. Also, Tmax is affected by the change in inlet height than the outlet height and the cooling effect is greatly influenced by gap spacing between the cells. Fan He et al. [81] developed and validated a reduced-order model (ROM) to control both the cell core and surface temperature of a Li-ion battery module with active temperature control and reciprocating airflow. The proposed cooling strategy improves the temperature uniformity, reduces the temperature fluctuation among cells as well as the total amount of cooling flow required. 4.1.1.2 Based on the fin structure The fins are the extended surfaces that enhance the heat transfer rate by increasing convection. These fins in different shapes and sizes have been coupled with the air-cooled BTMS to get a more efficient thermal management system and studied by the researchers. Shahabeddin K. Mohammadian et al. [67] designed a pin fin heat sink based air cooling as shown in Fig. 9 for thermal analysis of a prismatic Li-ion battery pack. The results showed that the pin fins with uniform heights not only decrease the bulk temperature but also decrease the temperature deviation inside the battery pack. A 3D transient thermal analysis is performed [68] to depict the effects of using a pin fin heat sink with porous metal foam on an air-cooled module of LIBs. Five separate combinations of these two cooling methods are elucidated to recognize the most suitable one for TMS in EVs and HEVs. Among 5 different choices, the combination of aluminum pin fins and porous aluminum foam insertion inside the airflow channel results in the best choice for thermal management. 4.1.1.3 Based on different cell configurations The battery cells being the most essential part of the BTMS, are arranged in various configurations. The simple modification in the position of batteries can change its performance to some extent. Yuqian Fan et al. [57] experimentally studied a forced-air cooled battery pack with 32 cylindrical LIBs in three different cell arrangements of aligned, staggered, and cross arrays and found that the aligned cell array gives better cooling performance followed by the staggered and cross array. Also, space utilization and power consumption are low in the aligned structure. Fig. 10 shows the aligned and staggered cell arrangement. Naixing Yang et al. [58] also studied and concluded that the aligned cell configuration is a suitable solution for designing the forced-air cooled battery pack. Xiaoling Yu et al. [69] experimentally studied the transient thermal characteristics of a staggered battery pack with natural and forced-air cooling. It is suggested that to extend the lifespan of the battery pack, forced-air cooling with longitudinal airflow should be adopted for practical EVs than natural convection and the DOD should be within 84.2% for the proposed system. Z. Lu et al. [72] conducted a numerical study on densely packed battery modules with 15 vents and 59 vents with forced-air cooling. It is observed that the thermal performance of a densely-packed module with 59 vents is more effective than 15 vents due to heat transfer area enhancement between air and battery surfaces. It is recommended not to continuously increase the size of the cooling channel to reduce the maximum battery temperature. A forced-convection battery cooling technique [82] is investigated for a square-shaped and a rectangular-shaped battery pack consisting of 16 cylindrical LIB cells and concluded that the heat dissipation of the battery pack depends on its shape along with the different parameters. After reviewing numerous articles on air-cooled BTMS, it can be inferred that the energy efficiency of natural convection is inadequate and it does not meet the requirements for higher energy density battery packs for EVs and HEVs. The cooling performance of air cooling confronts some problems such as a rise in battery surface temperature, maximum temperature rise, and uneven temperature distribution between cells or battery modules/packs due to the low thermal conductivity and low specific heat capacity of air [40]. To overcome these problems, several additive techniques are suggested in the literature and are represented in Fig. 5. The change in the number of air inlet and outlet, its location on the battery pack, arrangement of cells, variations in the air-flow channel have a great effect on maximum temperature and temperature uniformity. Table-2 gives a summary of the work reported in the literature about air-cooled BTMS. Air cooling is used in preceding versions of electric cars such as Volkswagen EV race car, Nissan Leaf. Electric vehicles being the future of the world, Tesla and other manufactures suggested liquid cooling for battery thermal management as the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of liquid coolants are higher than air [83]. Several experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on natural and forced-air cooled BTMS, some of which are recorded in Table 2. As can be seen from this table, various modified cooling methods are adjoined with the forced-air cooling technique which shows remarkable results in the Tmax and ∆Tmax of a cell or an entire battery pack at selected battery load or discharge rates. Furthermore, it is observed that as the velocity of air and discharge rate increases, the energy efficiency of the system decreases which ultimately leads to the rise in power consumption in forced-air cooling. This makes the air-cooled BTMS less efficient and to overcome these, a liquid cooling technique has been implemented for thermal management of Li-ion batteries for commercial purposes. 4.2 Liquid-cooled BTMS The liquid cooling system provides better thermal performance and cooling efficiency. It is the most commercialized technique for battery cooling and can be used directly or indirectly in contact with the coolant and battery surface. Chevrolet Volt, Tesla Model S and Model 3, BMW i3 and i8 [9,97] are the commercial liquid-cooled electric vehicles. The Tesla Model S has patented serpentine channeled liquid cooling system and the coolant used is a mixture of water and ethylene glycol solution. Various heat transfer fluids such as water [97–103], de-ionized water [104], a mixture of ethylene glycol and water [105,106], mineral oil [107], liquid metal [108], Al2O3-water nanofluids [109], etc. are utilized for direct and indirect liquid-based battery cooling system. Fig. 11 represents the in-depth classification of the liquid cooling technique. The studies conducted on the liquid cooling system with some simple modifications (as stated in Fig. 11) are discussed in the subsequent sections. 4.2.1 Experimental and numerical analysis of liquid-cooled BTMS The cooling efficiency of a liquid-cooled BTMS is greatly affected by the flow channels implemented to the battery pack for the flow of coolant through it. Various parameters such as the number of channels, channel height, channel width, mass flow rate are investigated by the investigators to achieve maximum cooling efficiency. Some of the researchers investigated the direct liquid cooling method for cooling the battery pack [110,111]. A few studies based on cold plate-based liquid cooling are discussed here. 4.2.1.1 Cold plate with parallel design Liquid cooling using a cold plate (mini/micro-channel) is highly investigated in the literature. These mini/micro-channels are distributed in a parallel flow pattern and are investigated for their structural and operating parameters. Yutao Huo et al. [98] designed a 3D thermal model of a parallel flow mini-channel cold plate liquid cooling system as shown in Fig. 12 and investigated the effects of various parameters on the thermal performance of a rectangular LIB pack. Results indicated that the Tmax decreases with the increase in the number of flow channels and inlet mass flow rate. Also, as the mass flow rate increases, the effect of flow direction on cooling diminishes. It is found that 5×10−4 kg/s is an optimal mass flow rate, above which the system efficiency will decrease. Jiateng Zhao et al. [100] numerically investigated the thermal characteristics of a mini-channel liquid-cooled cylinder cooling method (Fig. 13 ) and the effect of various influencing parameters on it. It is found that a minimum of 4 channels are required to keep the Tmax of batteries below 40°C and a maximum of 8, beyond which there is no significant results are obtained. S. Panchal et al. [103] studied the rate of heat generations of a liquid-cooled prismatic battery (Fig. 14 ) at 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C discharge rates and different boundary conditions (BCs) of 5°C, 15°C, 25°C, and 35°C using Artificial Neural Network Model. The results concluded that with the increasing discharge rates, the rate of heat generation increases. Also, the highest heat generation is found to be 91 W and the lowest is 13 W measured at 4C and 1C discharge rate respectively. Zhen Qian et al. [112] proposed a mini channel cold plate (Fig. 15 ) based TMS for LIBs and investigated it numerically. For achieving better temperature response by increasing the coolant flow rate, a 5-channel cold-plate is sufficient and an additional plate can be added to enhance cooling and temperature uniformity. Xinhai Xu et al. [5] studied the thermal performance of a parallel circular mini-channel liquid-cooled prismatic LiFePO4 batteries (Fig. 16 ) at 1C discharge rate and 40°C ambient temperature. A cold plate with a T-shape bifurcated structure is designed for uniform water distribution in all cold plates and mini-channels. Tmax and ΔTmax obtained are 32.5°C and around 1.5°C respectively using an active water-cooling system. Experimentation can be performed to evaluate the battery performance and life. Wenzheng Li et al. [117] numerically investigated modular water-cooled BTMS for a 70 Ah prismatic Li-ion battery module. A similar cold plate design as [5] was used in this study. The average temperature and temperature variation between batteries reduced with the decrease in water inlet temperature and increase in water flow rate and is found to be 34.5°C and less than 1.8°C respectively at 28°C water inlet temperature and 1 g/s flow rate. Yoong Chung et al. [119] conducted thermal analysis and CFD simulation of a liquid-cooled pouch battery pack using ANSYS FLUENT 17.0. Different structural designs of battery packs are suggested, evaluated, and compared to improve the performance of the proposed BTMS. A comparison between various battery designs is presented in this study and the results can be used as guidelines to design the large battery packs for EV. Yuqi Huang et al. [118] proposed a streamline shape mini channel cooling plates BTMS (Fig. 17 ) to optimize the performance of heat exchanger in the inner flow field. Results pointed out that the proposed concept can improve the heat exchanger efficiency as high as 44.52%. The flow resistance, the pressure difference can be effectively reduced and a more uniform temperature can be obtained by a streamline shaped cooling plate. The cooling ability of streamline shape and straight channels cooling plate are quite the same, so the effects of different channel numbers on the cooling performance can be further investigated using the same concept. The aluminum mini-channel cold plate-based liquid cooling system is optimized and numerically studied by Aikun Tang et al. [120] to investigate the thermal behavior of a large-capacity square battery. Three different design configurations have been modeled to study the effect of cooling structure on battery performance. The optimized results showed that the cooling structure with two cold plates at the side and one at the bottom of the battery packs give a good cooling effect as compared to the other two structures. The optimized results are a coolant flow rate of 2 L/min, a coolant inlet temperature of 20°C, and a 2C discharge rate. A liquid cooling system with variable contact resistance (Fig. 18 ) is investigated by Zhonghao Rao et al. [20] to reduce the temperature difference by placing an Al block between two cells. By comparing the results of the constant contact surface and the variable contact surface, it is found that the changeable length of Al block decreases the maximum temperature to the same value as that of the length 24 mm but the more uniform temperature is obtained with a decrease in system weight. It is suggested that to achieve better cooling performance only by increasing the velocity is not a good choice as it leads to more pump power consumption. Zhuangzhuang Shang et al. [121] proposed a liquid cooling system with a variable contact surface for a Li-ion battery pack. In liquid cooling, it is arduous to advance overall performance by optimizing only a single parameter. Therefore, optimization of mass flow rate, inlet temperature, and cooling plate width is carried out and the best cooling performance is achieved at 0.21 kg/s mass flow rate, 18°C inlet temperature, and cooling plate of width 70 mm. S. Panchal et al. [122] tested the thermal behavior of the LiFePO4 battery pack at lower current rates with the range of ambient temperatures using water cooling. Three prismatic LIBs are kept in series with 4 micro-channel cold plates inserted in between them are tested and analyzed at 20A (1C) and 40A (2C) with 35°C, 25°C, 15°C, and 5°C. Results indicated that the foremost vital estimation of normal surface temperature is obtained for 40 A and 35°C and the slightest is procured for 20A and 5°C using water cooling. Jiaqiang E et al. [123] conducted a numerical study on a rectangular channel and cold plate-based BTMS. The effects of the number of channels, channel width, channel height, and coolant velocity are analyzed by adopting an orthogonal experimental design method and the results showed that the influence of channel number is more dominant followed by the coolant velocity, channel width, and channel height. M. Malik et al. [124] thermally and electrically evaluated a liquid-cooled LiFePO4 battery pack at various discharge rates and operating coolant temperatures from 10°C-40°C. The experimental results concluded that the desired operating range (25–40°C) can be limited to 30°C coolant temperature at all discharge rates from 1C-4C. The thermal conductivity of liquid metal is much more than that of water which makes it an exquisite coolant for liquid cooling. Xiao-Hu Yang et al. [108] proposed a liquid metal-based cooling system for a prismatic Li-ion battery as shown in Fig. 14. The mathematical analysis and numerical simulation proved that liquid metal is an effective coolant for thermal management of batteries in stressful and abuse conditions for EVs. The only limitation of liquid metal is its weight which makes TMS heavier. Zhoujian An et al. [125] conducted thermal and electrochemical investigations of prismatic LiFePO4 power battery cells based on flow boiling in mini-channels BTMS using Hydrofluoroether NOVEC 7000 as a coolant at different discharge rates and Reynolds number (Re). The proposed BTMS maintains the Tmax and maximum surface temperature difference of the battery around 40°C and 4°C respectively. It is seen that with the rise in Re number of fluid due to a fall in temperature, a voltage drop occurs. B. Mondal et al. [126] analyzed the efficiency of nanofluids for thermal management of Li-ion batteries for EVs. CuO and Al2O3 nanoparticles are added to pure water and a mixture of water-ethylene glycol as liquid coolants. The results reveal that the addition of nanofluids to base coolants does not significantly improve the thermal performance of Li-ion batteries despite increasing thermal conductivity. A battery pack with 5 rectangular li-ion batteries is cooled by a circuitous rectangular channel through which water was passed as a coolant and is tested at a 5C discharge rate [127]. The temperature drops of 17.313℃ and 19.693℃ are observed at 0.25×10 6 m3/s and 1.6×10 6 m3/s flow rates, respectively. A flow reversal technique is also suggested to achieve better cooling using a liquid cooling system. 4.2.1.2 Cold plate with serpentine design The cold plate with serpentine channels is the commercial liquid cooling technique patented by Tesla for their electric cars. Various researchers have studied these serpentine channeled cold plates for battery thermal management. Li-ion battery cell using CFD simulation and experimentation at different discharge rates and operating temperatures was conducted by S. Panchal et al. [101]. It is observed that the temperature of the cold plate increases with the increase in discharge rate and operating temperature and the temperature near electrodes is higher than the temperature of the core of the battery. S. Panchal et al. [102] studied the thermal modeling and temperature variations in a prismatic LIB pack cooled with cold plates at different discharge rates and boundary conditions using the neural network approach. The results demonstrated that the change in discharge rate and boundary conditions remarkably affects the temperature distribution of the battery pack. Also, the velocity and temperature distributions of a mini-channel cold plate cooling for a prismatic. Fig. 19 shows a prismatic battery with a zig-zag turn cold plate studied in [101,102]. Anthony Jarrett et al. [105,106] designed and numerically simulated the performance of a vortex-shaped cold plate liquid cooling BTMS (Fig. 20 ) and also optimized its design for better energy efficiency. Dafen Chen et al. [221] performed electrochemical-thermal modeling of air, direct liquid, indirect liquid, and fin cooling and observed that indirect liquid cooling has the highest ΔTmax point as it has the longest coolant channel. The findings of the simulation are useful for determining and selecting a suitable method of cooling under volumetric constrain. Nieto et al. [116] also designed a serpentine channeled cold plate (Fig. 21 ) for a liquid-cooled BTMS with ethylene glycol-water mixture as a coolant and found that the Tmax and ∆Tmax are well below 35℃ and 5℃. Siqi Chen et al. [128] studied the thermal and fluid dynamics performance of a liquid-cooled BTMS as shown in Fig. 22 by simulation and experimentation using water as a coolant and found that the proposed BTMS resulted in a temperature reduction of 1.87°C and the temperature deviation less than 0.35°C. Joseph Raj Chandra Kanth B P et al. [129] designed a cold plate liquid cooling system and investigated the effects of various parameters on the battery pack thermal performance. Two designs with 6.3 mm and 7.5 mm diameters were examined for two coolants: water and 50:50 water-ethylene glycol mixtures. The CFD simulation results indicated that design 2 with 7.5 mm diameter performs better than design 1 with 6.3 mm diameter and water as a coolant is preferred than water-ethylene glycol mixture as the pressure drop is less in previous cases. The proposed system does not perform well beyond the 1.25C rate. Yubai Li et al. [130] performed 3D thermal modeling of a 20 Ah prismatic Li-ion battery and a 50 V battery pack based on mini channel cold plate cooling and investigated its thermal responses under stressful conditions. Subscale electrochemical modeling is also performed using the equivalent circuit model. It is observed that the coolant velocity has a major impact on battery thermal performance, so an appropriate coolant velocity is crucial to maintain Tmax and ΔTmax of battery and battery pack below 40°C and 5°C respectively. Also, a mini channeled cold plate with sufficient coolant velocity at the center of the battery module exhibit excellent thermal performance at a 5C discharge rate. The study inferred that the proposed modeling framework is a province for quantitative thermal analysis and to design BTMS for LIBs. Tao Deng et al. [131] numerically investigated the effect of design parameters on cooling performance of serpentine channel cold plate using STAR-CCM + solver. It is found that the cooling efficiency increases up to five channels and along with the length direction layout as compared with the width-layout. Also, the Tmax of the cold plate increases with the increase in coolant temperature whereas it has little influence on pressure drop and temperature deviation. Tao Deng et al. [10] investigated the thermal performance of a cold plate liquid-cooled BTMS using CFD simulation and found that as the mass flow of coolant increases, Tmax and ΔTmax reduces. It is also suggested that 1 g/s is the most suitable mass flow of coolant and cold plates should be kept at the center of the battery to achieve better heat dissipation. Uniform temperature distribution can be improved by different coolant flow direction; however, maximum temperature reduction remains unaffected. Fig. 23 shows the serpentine channel cold plate used in [10,131]. Lei Sheng et al. [133] analyzed the effects of inlet and outlet arrangements on the liquid cooling plates (LCP). A serpentine channel LCP with double inlets and outlets is designed and the effects of various parameters on cooling performance are investigated numerically. Results showed that it is beneficial to design the inlet and outlet on the opposite side of the LCP than on the same side, also increasing the mass flow rate and width of the channel reduce Tmax but has a low impact on ΔTmax of the battery module. It is suggested that the proposed design can be implemented to Li-ion BTMS. Jiaqiang E et al. [132] designed a serpentine channel cold plate (Fig. 24 ) to cool the battery. A thermal resistance model and the corresponding objective function are developed to analyze the thermal behavior of the system. This research study provides the easiest way to design cold plate liquid cooling with optimum cooling efficiency and minimum pressure loss. A channeled liquid cooled-based battery pack is analyzed by Chunrong Zhao et al. [134] to reduce its thermal non-uniformity. To elucidate this problem, two strategies are chased: 1 with the multiple short channels and another with the orderly magnified contact areas between the battery and coolant channel which reduces the temperature non-uniformity of battery pack lower than 2.2°C and 0.7°C at a 5C discharge rate respectively. The authors do not claim that the proposed strategies are the only promising solution to reduce thermal non-uniformity as there are numerous methods to do it. Wenjiong Cao et al. [135] performed a thermal analysis of a whole 18,650 cylindrical LIB pack cooled by channeled liquid flow system using CFD simulation and validated by experimentation. The experimental results are in sound agreement with the numerical one. Results showed that the increase in C-rate deteriorates battery performance whereas an increase in coolant rate enhances it. 4.2.1.3 Discrete tube The discrete tubes in flattened-shape or circular shape are coupled with cold plates and are made of various metals. The copper tubes and the aluminum tubes are attached to the surface of the cold plate or passed through the batteries for cooling. A numerical model is developed for a mini-channel liquid-cooled system (Fig. 25 ) [136], optimized and validated with the 3D conjugate heat transfer model from the past study by varying the structural and operating parameters of the proposed cooling system. The results showed that it is sufficient to cool half the cell surface on one side of the cell to keep ΔTmax below 3°C at a discharge rate of 2C. Xinxi Li et al. [137] experimentally investigated a silicon cold plate assisted copper tubes BTMS (Fig. 26 ) to enhance cooling performances and compared it with a silicon cold plate based natural and forced air cooling BTMS. The proposed system can maintain the Tmax and ΔTmax below 41.92°C and 1.78°C at 8 mL/s volume flow rate. It is suggested that the proposed cooling system is an effective BTMS than the other two systems with less energy consumption. A fins-augmented copper tubes BTMS with graphene oxide-modified silica gel (GO-SG) (Fig. 27 ) is experimentally investigated by Youfu Lv et al. [138] and found that the proposed approach maintains the Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery within 40°C and 4°C respectively. Also, the thermal performance of this novel technique is much better than the air-cooled and water-cooled module without GO-SG. Haobing Zhou et al. [139] examined the thermal performance of a cylindrical LIB cooled with a half helical duct-based liquid cooling (Fig. 28 ) system at a 5C discharge rate and investigated the effects of various parameters on cooling performance. Results showed that the thermal characteristics of the battery are improved by increasing the mass flow rate of coolant and there is no effect of pitch and number of ducts on cooling performance whereas it is improved by changing the flow direction and diameter of the duct. The Tmax and achieved are 30.5°C and 4.6°C respectively. Ke Li et al. [140] experimentally and numerically investigated water-cooled BTMS for LIBs under dynamic cycling as shown in Fig. 29 . For a low cycling rate, active water cooling is a prominent method amongst all and can be recommended for high cycling rates integrated thermal management systems. Chuanjin Lan et al. [113] numerically examined the thermal performance of a prismatic Li-ion battery cooled by Al mini-channel tubes (Fig. 30 ) under different discharge rates, flow rates, and configurations and found that the Tmax of 27.8°C and ΔTmax of 0.8°C can be obtained at 1C rate. Suman Basu et al. [97] explored a liquid cooling system (Fig. 31 ) where the cells are connected thermally by conducting elements that can extract the generated heat and concluded that this cooling system can efficiently control the temperature even at high discharge rates with low coolant mass flow and can be implemented to EVs. The problems associated with liquid cooling such as coolant leakage and disposal are taken care of in commercialization. Recently passive thermal management using phase change materials (PCMs) has been developed as an alternative to active cooling systems [23]. Table-3 gives the summary of work reported in the literature about liquid-cooled BTMS. Table-3 provides a detailed insight into the experimental and numerical studies conducted on liquid-cooled BTMS in the literature. Several researchers have studied and investigated the effects of structural and operating parameters on the life and performance of liquid-cooled LIBs using various thermal models. Recently passive thermal management using phase change materials (PCMs) has been developed as an alternative to active cooling systems [23]. 4.3 PCM-based BTMS Owing to high latent heat, PCMs possess the ability to absorb an enormous amount of heat produced by the Li-ion batteries and can reduce the Tmax and ΔTmax of the battery cells by keeping the temperature within the PCM melting range [142]. Al-Hallaj et al. [142] pioneered the research on the 18,650 type of Li-ion battery cooling with PCM-based BTMS. R. Kizilel et al. [143], Zhonghao Rao et al. [144], and Siddique A. Khateeb et al. [145] designed and discussed the thermal management of PCM-based passive BTMS. The study [146] revealed that the problem with PCM cooling is its lower thermal conductivity. Various methods such as the addition of metal foams [145], metal fins [147], expanded graphite [148], etc. are adapted to enhance the thermal conductivity of pure PCMs forming composite phase change materials (CPCM). Fig. 32 shows the possible ways to improve the thermal conductivity of pure PCM. The literature reveals that paraffin is the commonly preferred phase change material as it has high latent heat and low cost, and mostly adopted PCM to form composite PCMs. Based on this classification (Fig. 32), the various experimental and numerical studies conducted on PCM for battery cooling are explained in the corresponding text. 4.3.1 Experimental and numerical analysis of PCM-cooled BTMS A phase change material is an intriguing substitute to conventional air and liquid cooling systems as it works as both passive and semi-passive system [52]. The literature reveals that the research studies conducted on PCM cooled BTMS are mainly focused on improving the thermal conductivity of pure PCM by using additive methods as enlisted in Fig. 32. Some of the recent works based on the methods of improving the thermal conductivity of PCM are discussed here. 4.3.1.1 Addition of metal foam The composite phase change materials are synthesized for improving the thermal conductivity of pure PCM and this method of addition of metal foam is the extensively studied one. The copper foam, aluminum foam, nickel foam are generally blended with paraffin wax or other base PCM. Minqiang Pan et al. [153] designed a cutting copper fiber sintered skeleton (CCFSS) + paraffin CPCM to cool a Li-ion battery pack (Fig. 33 ) and compared it with the natural convection, pure paraffin, and (copper foam+paraffin) CPCM. The experimental results showed that the CCFSS+paraffin CPCM enhances the heat transfer rate and keeps the ΔTmax below 5°C at the end of the discharge as compared to the other cooling methods. Amine Lazrak et al. [154] proposed a novel method of enhancing PCM thermal conductivity by using copper grids and numerically investigated it to find the effect of melting temperature PCM. The findings are used to build a PCM based prototype BTMS. The experimental results of the prototype showed very assuring results and keep the temperature of cells within 5°C. Xiaoming Wang et al. [155] proposed a (copper foam + paraffin) composite PCM-based BTMS in which the PCM is indirectly in contact with the cell, unlike other PCM cooling systems. The proposed system can efficiently control the battery temperature within the desired range even at a 4C discharge rate and 42°C. Zichen Wang et al. [156] experimentally examined the melting process of paraffin in Al foam and its effect on Li-ion battery cooling. The results showed that the melting process of paraffin in the Al foam is prevailed by the heat diffusion and natural convection, embossing improvement in heat conduction. The composite PCM reduces the Tmax by 62.5% and 53% at 1C and 2C rates respectively with uniform temperature distribution. A (nickel foam + paraffin wax) CPCM [157] is developed for the thermal management of 18,650 batteries (Fig. 34 ) and compared with natural convection and pure PCM cooling. A reduction of 31% and 24% is obtained in battery surface temperature with the proposed CPCM as compared to natural and PCM cooling respectively under a 2C discharge rate. Also, (nickel foam + paraffin wax) is economical than most of the other metal foams listed in literature such as Cu foam [151,153,155,158], Al foam [145,147,156,159], EG/graphene foam [146], etc. The thermal performance of a composite board-based BTMS (Fig. 35 ) is numerically investigated by Jiajia Yan et al. [160] for a commercial prismatic 20 Ah LiFePO4 battery. This composite board provides better heat dissipation and temperature uniformity, also increases the battery pack heat insulation capability to prevent thermal runaway. Therefore, it is suggested to use PCM with 1125 kJ/kg of latent heat and 30.15°C and 50.15°C for BTMS. M. Alipanah et al. [159] numerically investigated the battery surface temperature and discharge time of LIBs using pure octadecane, pure gallium, and octadecane–Al foam composite as PCMs and compared their efficacy in TMS. It is found that the addition of Al-foam into octadecane significantly increases temperature uniformity along with the longer discharge time as compared to pure octadecane. Mohammad Mahdi Heyhat et al. [161] also compared the thermal performance of a PCM-cooled single 18,650 LIB with the addition of nanoparticles, fins, and porous metal foam (Fig. 36 ) and observed that the porous metal foam composite PCM performs better than the other two additives with the reduction of 4–6°C in mean temperature of the battery. Also, these additives can be tested for a battery pack than a single cell to analyze better thermal behavior. 4.3.1.2 Addition of carbon-based materials The carbon-based materials used in PCM possess excellent thermal, chemical, physical, and electrical properties and are present in the form of graphene, carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, etc [162]. These are added to the PCM and tested for PCM-based battery cooling system. Deqiu Zou et al. [162] experimentally tested a novel PCM-based BTMS (Fig. 37 ) to enhance the heat transfer performance of the battery module. An EG+graphene+carbon nanotubes+paraffin CPCM is synthesized and characterized in this study which has no-leakage concern and high thermal conductivity. It is seen that the Tmax and ΔTmax are 43.8°C and 1.9°C for 16 batteries and 44.6°C and 0.8°C for 4 batteries respectively which indicates that there is a slight rise in Tmax (0.8°C) but the ΔTmax drop is 46.7% using CPCM. Xiaohang Luo et al. [163] experimentally investigated a novel PCM (NPCM) composite (Paraffin+EG+Epoxy resin) coupled with graphite film (Fig. 38 ) for controlling the temperatures of LIBs. The dual-phase transition of this NPCM caters to a double buffer effect to enhance the thermal performance of the battery pack. Accordingly, the Tmax and ΔTmax of the batteries are 33°C and 1.4°C respectively at a 4C rate. It is concluded that the NPCM performs better without the extra power consumption and additional components during stressful conditions. Jieshan He et al. [164] synthesized a new CPCM of expanded graphite+copper foam (EG+CF) and experimentally investigated its thermal and physical properties for LiCoO2 batteries. The experimental results concluded that the proposed CPCM enhanced mechanical strength and cooling performance, and also performs well with forced air convection. Umit Nazli Temel et al. [165] investigated the thermal performance of a CPCM-based BTMS. Graphene Nanoplatelet (GNP) is added to paraffin wax (RT-44) at different mass fractions from 0%-7% and the characterization shows that 7%GNP/RT-44 performs better. The thermal conductivity of RT-44 is improved by adding 7% GNP, though it has no impact on the melting temperature of composites. Numerical results indicated that the prepared CPCM (7% GNP/ RT-44) gives better thermal performance than pure RT-44. A PCM-based BTMS with three different shape-stabilized PCM plate (PCMP) (Fig. 39 ) made of (PA+EG) is proposed by Weixiong Wu et al. [166] to improve the thermal performance of a prismatic LiFePO4 battery. The PCMP wrapped around the cell configuration gives better thermal performance than the PCMP on the broad and narrow side of the battery. It is found that the PCM thickness of 2.08 mm and the convective heat transfer coefficient of 10 W/m2K should be adopted for the PCMP around the cell. The proposed configurations can be optimized to minimize the size and cost of PCM based BTMS. Yantong Li et al. [167] optimized the thermal performance of a (PA+EG) PCM-based BTMS to minimize the mass of PCM while assuring that the desired working time and maximum temperature difference within limits. The results of this study can be used as guidelines for designing PCM based battery cooling systems. A (PA+EG) CPCM-based BTMS in dynamic cycling of EV battery packs is tested by Jiajia Yan et al. [168] and compared with natural air cooling and found that the CPCM cooling system is more effective than natural convection for efficient thermal management. It is suggested to keep the PCT of PCM at 45°C. Yi-Huan Huang et al. [169] numerically and experimentally investigated flexible CPCMs based BTMS for the thermal management of the Li-ion battery pack. Two flexible CPCMs are synthesized in this study: one with eicosane and the other with tetracosane having PCT of 33°C for low power levels and low ambient temperature and 47°C for high power levels, and high ambient temperatures. Experimental results showed that the battery temperature reduces by 18°C at a discharge rate of 10 C using flexible CPCMs. Leila Ghadbeigi et al. [170] examined a PCM-based cooling system for LIB modules during cold stops in winter and made a comparison based on no PCM, paraffin wax as PCM, and (paraffin wax + expanded graphite) as commercial PCM for EVs and HEVs. The results revealed that the commercial PCM LIB module performs in between no PCM and PCM module. Xuan Zhang et al. [171] prepared a novel ternary (Kaolin+EG+PA) CPCM for thermal management of a single 1,965,140 battery and battery pack. The selected CPCM effectively controls the temperature rise of a single battery but raises the ΔTmax of the battery pack due to the affluence of PCM in some parts. Therefore, a reasonable allocation of the PCM in the battery pack should be considered. A novel (PA+EG+LDPE+NS) CPCM with no-leakage and no-volume-changes properties is synthesized by Youfu Lv et al. [172] for cooling of 18,650 Li-ion power batteries and found that the proposed CPCM performs splendidly for thermal management of the battery pack. Ziye Ling et al. [173] investigated the most suitable PCM for the thermal management of low temperatures operated battery packs. A (60wt% RT44HC+EG) composite with high thermal conductivity and a (60wt% RT44HC+fumed silica) composite with low thermal conductivity are tested with no PCM condition. The results concluded that the PCM with low thermal conductivity performs worse than cooling without PCM and (60wt% RT44HC+EG) composite is the suitable choice for battery packs working at low operating temperature (5 to 10°C). A. Babapoor et al. [152,174] experimentally investigated the effect of carbon fiber mass fraction and length on the thermal management of paraffin cooled simulated battery. The carbon fiber enhanced PCM significantly improves the thermal conductivity of the paraffin mixture and the results revealed that 2-mm long fibers at a mass fraction of 0.46% provide the best thermal performance. This carbon fiber loaded PCM is a suitable medium for battery module/pack TMS. An EG matrix/PCM cooling system as shown in Fig. 41 is experimentally and numerically examined by Chunjing Lin et al. [175] for the thermal management of a rectangular battery pack. EG matrix and graphite sheets are adapted with PCM to enhance thermal conductivity and temperature uniformity. It is found that the Tmax of the battery pack is reduced by 32% and 37% at 1C and 2C discharge rates respectively keeping the Δ Tmax below 5°C. The proposed CPCM can be implemented for rectangular and large capacity batteries in EV applications. M. Malik et al. [176] tested a phase change composite (PCC) material cooled system for a Li-ion battery pack using PCC 37–1000 as PCM and compared it with no cooling and liquid cooling conditions. The results showed that the proposed PCC cooling efficiently manages the thermal performance within the desired temperature range of 25–40°C at discharge rates of 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C as compared with other two cooling conditions. There is a problem with PCM leakage at a 4C discharge rate, therefore, a better battery pack design can be suggested to ensure no leakage. 4.3.1.3 Effect of metal fins on PCM The addition of fins to the PCM cooling system like air and liquid cooling system increases the rate of heat transfer and has been investigated for the same in PCM-cooled BTMS. A PCM-fin-based BTMS consists of longitudinal fins and cylindrical rings (as shown in Fig. 42 ) is proposed by Zhiqiang Sun et al. [177]. Thermal characteristics of the proposed system are investigated and compared with the air cooling and pure PCM cooling systems. It is found that the fin structure effectively improves the thermal performance of the battery by enhancing the heat transfer area and inducing a thermal conductive network. The proposed system performs well even under the 20 W heat generation rate. The thermal performance of a simulated battery (Fig. 43 ) is experimentally tested by Zhiwei Wang et al. [178] with composite paraffin and fin structured cooling system which resulted in good thermal performance over an extended period. Ping Ping et al. [179] designed a novel PCM-fin structure for the thermal management of a prismatic Li-ion battery module (Fig. 44 ) and are validated with the experiments. The fin structure parameters have positive and negative impacts on the cooling efficiency of the battery module. The optimized PCM-fin structure presents good thermal management and reduces the failure risk of passive PCM based BTMS. An analytical study is performed for a paraffin-based battery cooling system [180] and is tested with the applications of fins with various shapes and numbers at different discharge rates of 1C, 2C, and 3C. The results state that the fins with I-shape and rectangular shape provides better cooling and an optimum PCM thickness of 26 mm is found to be more effective for efficient thermal performance of a battery. Youfu Lv et al. [150] developed a ternary (LDPE/EG/PA) CPCM with low fins cooling system for Li-ion battery packs (Fig. 45 ) which provides better mechanical properties and superior cooling efficiency. The Tmax and ΔTmax obtained in this study is less than 50°C and 5°C respectively even at a 3.5 C discharge rate. 4.3.1.4 Effect of gap spacing and PCM thickness and melting temperature The performance of PCM-based BTMS is investigated by varying the spacing between the adjacent cells in a battery pack, thickness of PCM, and their effect on the phase change temperature. Fanfei Bai et al. [181] examined the thermal behavior of a PCM-based BTMS (Fig. 46 ) and investigated the influence of gap spacing between batteries, melting point, and thermal conductivity of PCMs on the cooling efficiency. The results showed that Tmax and ΔTmax are reduced with the increase in gap spacing and thermal conductivity whereas Tmax increases and ΔTmax decreases with the increase in the melting point of PCMs. The thermal performance of a single LIB using PCM cooling (Fig. 47 ) is experimentally investigated by Jingwen Weng et al. [182] and examined the effect of PCM thickness, phase change temperature (PCT) and rest time on the battery cooling performance. The results showed that the PCM thickness of about 10 mm provides optimal cooling performance and PCT selection ought to base on the specific application and requirements focusing on higher capacity battery retention. It is also shown that the cooling capacity improves as the rest time increases along with the further improvement in PCM cooling to overcome the inconsistency between the PCM thickness and the battery energy density. 4.3.1.5 Use of nano-PCM The PCM-based BTMS have increasingly gained more attention day by day and the addition of nanoparticles to it has become the research hotspot. A few investigators have synthesized CPCM using metal or carbon nanoparticles for PCM cooling and tested it for the thermal performance of battery packs. G. Karimi et al. [184] examined and compared the thermal performance of a battery type simulator with various PCM composites such as (Metal matrix + PCM), (Metal Nanoparticles + PCM). From the results, it is concluded that the least battery temperature is achieved by Ag nanoparticles CPCM and the least temperature difference is achieved by metal matrix composite PCM as compared to rest. Farid Bahiraei et al. [185] numerically and experimentally investigated several types of carbon-based nanoparticles as additives for pure paraffin. The study revealed that the thermal performance of paraffin was degraded by the addition of carbon nanoparticles and graphene platelets whereas it was enhanced by the addition of graphite-based nanocomposites. Also, the addition of nanoparticles to the paraffin restrain natural convection. 4.3.1.6 Alternatives to conventional PCMs As stated earlier, paraffin is the extensively used and investigated PCM for cooling of batteries, some investigators have come up with the idea of using alternatives to it. Ryo Koyama et al. [186] suggested hydrates to use as PCMs as the conventional PCMs have some limitations such as low thermal conductivity, low heat of fusion, corrosive and flammable, etc. and proposed a Trimethylolethane (TME) hydrate as a PCM suitable for cooling Li-ion batteries in EVs as it possesses large heat dissociation and is inflammable. A novel Poly Ethylene Glycol 1000 (PEG1000) PCM is synthesized by Y. Azizi et al. [187]. The thermal conductivity and temperature uniformity are improved by adapting Al wire mesh plates. These Al wire mesh plates coupled with PEG1000 provide a better thermal performance of the battery pack and the maximum cell surface temperature of the battery pack is reduced by 19%, 21%, and 26% at 1C, 2C, and 3C discharge rates respectively. Ashima Verma et al. [188] analyzed the effects of PCM on temperature distribution during high discharge rates in the batteries. The non-paraffin PCM, Capric acid (fatty acid) has been explored in this study as it has sharper phase transformation. From the results, it is deduced that the capric acid exhibits better results than paraffin as it reduced the temperature to 32°C with 3 mm PCM thickness in comparison with 9 mm paraffin which reduces the temperature to 36°C. Despite having several advantages, it is still a hot research spot as no practical implementation of PCM cooling to the automotive application is performed yet. Brief outcomes of the PCM-cooled techniques are summarized in the discussion section. Table 4 provides an outline of the studies published in the literature about PCM based BTMS. PCM-based BTMS are often integrated with conventional battery cooling techniques such as air or liquid cooling to increase energy efficiency and the cooling efficiency of the battery pack systems. As can be seen from Table 4, paraffin is the most studied PCM even if blended with the additives to improve the thermal conductivity of the base PCM. Better temperature uniformity and lower Tmax are the outcomes of PCM-based BTMS. 4.4 Heat pipe based BTMS A heat pipe (HP) based passive TMS has been widely utilized in recent years for temperature control of battery packs. Heat pipes are heat transfer devices filled with a small amount of fluid that evaporates to generate heat [195]. The heat pipe is divided into the evaporation section, adiabatic section, and condensing section [195]. The heating of the evaporation section causes the evaporation of working fluid which will generate vapor and carries the heat produced by the battery to the condenser section, where the vapor fluid releases heat into the atmosphere and condenses into a liquid [195]. The heat pipe has the advantages of super-high thermal conductivity [196], flexibility, lightweight, cost-effectiveness, reliability [19,197], etc. Various researchers have been conducted studies on different types of HPs such as ultra-thin micro heat pipe (UMHP) [198], vertical closed-loop oscillating heat pipes [199], micro heat pipe array (MHPA) [200], oscillating heat pipe (OHP) [197], Flexible Oscillating Heat Pipe (FOHP) [201], Flat plate loop heat pipe (FPLHP) [202] and stated that the HP based BTMS is an effective solution for thermal management of batteries. Fig. 48 represents the types of heat pipes studied and investigated by various researchers in the literature. The experimental and numerical analysis of HP-based BTMS along with the modifications and implementations performed on it are explored here. 4.4.1 Experimental and numerical analysis of HP-based BTMS Heat pipes are the passive thermal management systems for cooling batteries and are investigated in various shapes and sizes even with different orientations for a more efficient BTMS. Dan Dan et al. [200] developed a micro-heat pipe array (MHPA) based BTMS (Fig. 49 ) and analyzed its dynamic thermal characteristics. CFD simulation of MHPA is very complex. Hence, an equivalent thermal resistance network model based on the traditional heat pipe model is established to study the thermal behavior of a battery under dynamic working conditions. Results revealed that the MHPA based BTMS can keep the temperature below 40°C with free convection and the ΔTmax below 2°C. It gives excellent thermal performance under dynamic working conditions compared with the forced convection system. Jianqin Wang et al. [196] analyzed the sensitivity of influential parameters of a heat pipe-based BTMS (Fig. 50 ) using an orthogonal numerical test. CFD analysis is performed and validated with experiment for the battery module temperature distribution. Results showed that the conduction element height affects the battery thermal behavior more sensitively followed by the circumference angle between conduction element and battery, gap spacing, and the thickness of conduction element. The best thermal performance of 27.62°C as Tmax and 1.08°C as ΔTmax is obtained when the conduction element height and thickness are 60 mm and 4 mm respectively, circumference angle is 120° and battery spacing is 19 mm. A plug-in oscillating heat pipe (OHP) consisting of a flat plate evaporator and a tube condenser (Fig. 51 ) is experimentally tested for thermal management of LIBs by Aibo Wei et al. [197]. Pure water, ethanol, and a mixture of them are used as coolants with different mixing ratios and filling ratios. Results showed that the mixture of water and ethanol gives better heat transfer characteristics at 1:1 MR and 30% FR for a plug-in OHP. The proposed system reduces the average temperature of the battery pack to 46.5°C and keeps the ΔTmax below 2.5°C at 56 W heat dissipation rate, which is a viable solution for BTMS of EVs. Zhonghao Rao et al. [206] experimentally examined the thermal characteristics of heat pipe based BTMS of EVs and revealed that the Tmax and ΔTmax both can be maintained within the desired operating range when the heat generation rate is 30 W, even under transient operating conditions and cycle testing using a heat pipe. Q. Wang et al. [208] investigated the thermal performance of Heat Pipe in “off-normal” conditions, at an ambient temperature of 35°C and 20°C coolant temperature and found that the Tmax can be maintained under 40°C if heat generation rate is less than 10 W/cell. Jialin Liang et al. [83] experimentally investigated the thermal response of a heat pipe BTMS under different temperature and operating conditions. The power consumption is reduced with the intermittent cooling. The thermal performance of HP-BTMS enhanced slightly when the environment temperature is under 25°C and remains unchanged under 35°C. It is futile for BTMS to work instantly after the battery is started and hence, it is recommended to start the HP-BTMS after Tmax exceeds equilibrium value (namely, Tbf> 15°C under Tamb=15°C and Tbf> 10°C under Tamb=25°C). To improve the heat transfer process, Wu et al. [212] attached two heat pipes with Al fins to the battery wall and demonstrated that the heat pipe application can significantly reduce the temperature rise. Ye et al. [213] optimized a heat pipe-based BTMS (Fig. 52 ) to improve its performance under stressful conditions. Copper fins and copper heat spreaders are employed to the existing HP design; also a cylindrical vortex generator is placed before the condenser which enhances temperature uniformity. This improvised HP-BTMS shows better results even at the 8C rate. HP with forced-air cooling is numerically examined, but the results are not up to the expectations so in addition to forced air cooling; mist cooling should also be introduced into it. Later on, Yonghuang Ye et al. [207] experimentally studied the different cooling strategies by incorporating heat pipes to a TMS for prismatic or pouch batteries and optimized the system to enhance the cooling efficiency and temperature uniformity of the system. The proposed HP-BTMS is highly viable and compelling for fast charging LIBs. A “delay quench” cooling technique is applied to enhance the system performance which quenches the 25°C of the battery using 15°C coolant after the charging initiates with a time lag of 100 s and maintains the battery temperature within 25°C-40°C [207]. A flexible oscillating heat pipe (FOHP) based BTMS is investigated by Jian Qu et al. [201] for the thermal management of EVs and HEVs and revealed that the FOHP can be integrated as BTMS for EVs and HEVs. Putra et al. [202] designed a flat plate loop HP (Fig. 53 ) for e-vehicles, using distilled water, alcohol, and acetone as a heat transfer medium to increase heat transfer rate of a HP and claimed that acetone gives better thermal performance with HP. Despite several advantages, heat-pipes are not favorable for practical applications of EVs and HEVs. The applications of the heat pipe are still under initial development, and hence studies combine heat pipe with different cooling methods to achieve better thermal performance [38]. Table -5 gives a summary of the work reported in the literature about HP-based BTMS. In recent years, many investigators have studied and investigated the performance of HP-based BTMS by varying the shape, size, and orientation of it. Based on the literature, it was observed that Tmax has been controlled below 50℃ with the help of a heat pipe if the heat generation inside the battery pack is up to 50 W [206]. To achieve better thermal control, heat pipes can also be integrated with conventional cooling techniques. 4.5 Refrigeration based BTMS Refrigeration cooling is the modified battery cooling system in which the selected refrigerant is a phase change material that boils to produce vapor and cools the battery packs. R134a is the commonly studied refrigerant for refrigeration cooling. Few of the prominent literature are summarized in the subsequent text. 4.5.1 Experimental and numerical analysis of refrigeration-based BTMS The refrigeration cooling has become the new research spot for cooling of lithium-ion batteries. Maan Al-Zareer, Ibrahim Dincer, Marc A. Rosen have presented a significant contribution in the research domain of refrigeration-based thermal management systems for EVs and HEVs by varying the refrigerant and battery pack arrangements. A liquid to vapor-based BTMS is proposed by Maan Al-Zareer et al. [216] and numerically investigated for HEVs in which liquid propane is used as PCM. The results showed that the proposed system controls the temperature efficiently even at a 7.5 C charge-discharge rate and it is only specified for HEVs. A similar study [217] has been carried out using R-134a as a coolant in which the battery modules were submerged in the liquid R-134a in varying proportions. This battery cooling system works only when the ambient temperature and cabin temperature is less than 30°C. Further research can be done to overcome this dependency on the ambient temperature as well as the condensation and recycling of R-134a can be investigated. A Li-ion battery pack cooled with ammonia boiling (Fig. 55 ) is developed by Maan Al-Zareer et al. [218] for hybrid electric vehicles in which the ammonia is in direct contact with the battery surfaces and keeps the Tmax below 33°C by immersing only 5% front surface of the battery in ammonia pool. Thermal performance can be enhanced by increasing the battery area covered by the pool. A comparative study [219] of the same was carried out using propane, ammonia, and R134a as coolants and concluded that for both prismatic and cylindrical battery packs, ammonia works as the best coolant. Later on, research studies were conducted to find the effect of gap spacing between the batteries when they are submerged in the boiling pool. Propane [220] is used as a coolant that can be recycled and reused as fuel in HEVs after serving the cooling purpose. A similar kind of work [221] was performed with R134a as coolant with different ratios of gap spacings. The results indicated that the reduction in spacing between the batteries improves the temperature uniformity but also increases the Tmax of the battery pack. Hence, further arrangements of the battery spacing to be investigated for more efficient battery cooling [220,221]. A pumped two-phase cooling method using R1233zd as a refrigerant has been experimentally investigated by Yidong Fang et al. [222]. This concept has not been yet applied to BTMS. A fuzzy logic control program was coded and integrated with the experimentation to validate it under transient conditions. This study can be further explored for its feasibility under different thermal conditions of BTMS. Seonggi Park et al. [223] compared the performance of refrigerant-based BTMS and PCM-based BTMS and observed that the active refrigerant cooling provides better thermal management than PCM as it is independent of the ambient temperature. Ming Shen et al. [224] developed a fluid-solid coupling module for heat generation inside a battery pack for R-134a based BTMS and investigated the effect of various structural and operating parameters. This study adopted the structural design of a cold plate-based liquid cooling where R-134a is used as a coolant. Refrigeration cooling does not guarantee the prevention of TR but can prevent TR propagation from cell to cell. Ming Shen et al. [225] also studied the coupling of refrigeration and air-conditioning system and their utility for BTMS. Thermal performance of various components as well as energy and exergy analysis was also performed for the proposed system. A novel refrigerant HFE-7000 was also studied by Yan-Feng Wang et al. [226] which not only improves the heat transfer rate but also reduces the thermal contact resistance. The Tmax and ∆Tmax obtained were 35.1℃ and 3.71℃ respectively at a 5C rate. Seong Ho Hong et al. [227] investigated a two-phase refrigerant cooling having one refrigerant loop and one liquid coolant loop using R1234yf and 50:50 ethylene glycol-water mixture as heat transfer mediums. The proposed system could perform better than conventional liquid cooling and control the Tmax well below 45℃ even under abusive conditions. Based on the literature, it is observed that refrigeration cooling has only been studied for HEVs, its application to EVs are still under research. 4.6 Hybrid BTMS Literature reveals that the air, liquid, PCM, HP, and refrigeration cooling are capable of maintaining the thermal management of a battery pack within the desired range, but it has also been observed that the limitations of a single technique restrict the achievement of best possible thermal management. To integrate the advantages and overcome the disadvantages of a single cooling method, a combination of two or more cooling systems termed as hybrid cooling has been studied and developed by the investigators. The subsequent text addresses the summary of some of the recent evident literature on HTMS. 4.6.1 Experimental and numerical analysis of HTMS The literature revealed that a lot of research work has been conducted on integrating PCM cooling with conventional air and liquid cooling. PCM cooling is the most coupled technique to form HTMS to enhance the temperature uniformity as PCM can store heat in both latent and sensible form. 4.6.1.1 PCM integrated air cooling BTMS The hybrid cooling systems couples the advantages of more than one BTMS. The researchers have combined the active and passive cooling techniques to take the advantage of both as one cooling system. Ziye Ling et al. [23] presented a PCM integrated forced-air convection hybrid cooling system to prevent heat accumulation in PCMs and to study the thermal performance of 18,650 LIB packs. Results showed that the Tmax and ΔTmax are below 50°C and 3°C respectively at any rates lower than 2C. If the PCM has full thermal energy storage capacity, the Tmax and ΔTmax in the battery pack are independent of air velocity. The proposed hybrid system overcomes the limitations of conventional PCM cooling. Attention should be paid to reduce the weight of PCMs. Mehdi Mehrabi-Kermani et al. [228] designed and fabricated a novel hybrid thermal management system (HTMS) integrating PCM with forced-air cooling (Fig. 56 ) and experimentally investigated for the thermal management of LIBs under abuse and stressful conditions. It is concluded that the HTMS effectively uses 76.7% and 100% of the heat sink and PCM latent heat respectively at the onset of TR by keeping the system below 60°C with 33 minutes increment in time. There is no experimental simulation currently available to test the emergence of TR of LIB cells inside a thermal management framework. Ravindra D. Jilte et al. [229] proposed a cell-to-cell air cooling surrounded by PCM (Fig. 57 ) and investigated its thermal performance. Each cell is embedded by PCM and connected in series. It is observed that this novel confined PCM cooling performs better than conventional PCM cooling and the maximum cell temperature rise is found to be less than 5°C. The PCM thickness of 4 mm around each cell is appropriate to keep the vehicle weight unaffected. It is easy to vary the pack capacity as the cell-to-cell arrangement is present in this modified cooling system. Peng Qin et al. [22] examined a BTMS which integrates forced air cooling with PCM under dynamic cycling for 4 parallel Li-ion battery packs. The proposed BTMS effectively controls the Tmax and ΔTmax within the operating range even at a high discharge/charge rate of 4C. It is recommended that the PCM thickness of 5 mm should be considered for efficient cooling. Rami Sabbah et al. [230] performed numerical analysis for PCM cooling and forced-air convection and found that the PCM cooling is more efficient than the forced-air cooling under stressful conditions of high discharge and high operating temperatures. W. Wu et al. [231] experimentally examined a forced-air cooling with copper mesh enhanced paraffin and expanded graphite CPCM. The CPCM synthesized in this study provides an excellent thermal performance as compared to the PCM without copper mesh exclusively in severe operating conditions. A PCM + air cooling system is mathematically and experimentally analyzed by Shang Shi et al. [232] for a LIB pack used in the hybrid power train. The proposed ITMS provides impressive temperature control for LIBs, even if the PCM melts completely, air cooling helps to maintain the safe temperature range. Guiwen Jiang et al. [233] developed a tube-shell Li-ion battery pack with a PCM+forced-air cooling system to enhance the heat dissipation of the battery module. This tube-shell battery pack with PCM+forced-air cooling reduces cell temperature and maintains the ΔTmax below 1–2°C. Also, it evinced high heat dissipation efficiency. Yongqi Xie et al. [234] investigated the influence of airflow rate and liquid fraction of PCM on the thermal behavior of a PCM+air-cooled Li-ion battery in a hybrid power train. The deviation in the airflow rate and PCM liquid fraction would not result in a remarkable change in battery temperature. Even after the complete melting of PCM, air cooling maintains the maximum temperature rise. This ITMS keeps the Tmax below 49.2°C at 6 charge-discharge cycles without extra power consumption. 4.6.1.2 PCM integrated liquid cooling BTMS The liquid cooling system is the commercialized battery cooling system for electric vehicles but it has some disadvantages as stated in the previous sections of this article and these are overcome by integrating it with PCM cooling. Yanqi Zhao et al. [235] proposed an active liquid + PCM battery cooling. A 3D numerical modeling of proposed BTMS is performed using ANSYS FLUENT and investigated its thermal characteristics at different discharge rates. Pure PCM cannot manage the battery temperature efficiently even in coordination with the liquid cooling [216]. Hence, copper foam is added to pure PCM and found that the battery surface temperature is reduced to 14°C. Fanfei Bai et al. [183] proposed a BTMS (Fig. 58 ) based on the phase change slurry (PCS) with mini channel cooling plate and modeled using GAMBIT and FLUENT 17. The cooling performance of the PCS and other coolants are compared and found that the PCS consisting of 20% n-octadecane microcapsules and 80% water performs better than that of water, glycol solution, and mineral oil. Hengyun Zhang et al. [236] prototyped a hybrid (PCM+Bottom liquid cooling) BTMS and experimentally investigated the thermal characteristics of battery performance. A comparison between PCM cooling, liquid cooling, and hybrid cooling is also studied. As compared to liquid cooling, the Tmax of the battery is reduced by 10.6°C and the ΔTmax is reduced by 1.7°C by hybrid cooling. Hybrid cooling maintains Tmax below 50°C and ΔTmax around 3.4°C or below in cyclic discharge rate over 5C. Krishnadash S. Kshetrimayum et al. [237] proposed a (PCM + Micro-channel cooling plate) for preventing heat generation and TR in a battery module that has been harmed by nail penetration of up to three cells. Newman 2D pseudo-electrochemical model, thermal abuse model, and short-circuit model are used to produce 106 J/s of heat under stressful conditions with corresponding nail penetration and normal discharge. The proposed cooling system can prevent TR for nail penetration up to 3 cells. Zhiguo An et al. [238] studied a PCM+liquid cooling system and found that the temperature is exceeding beyond the desired limit at a 3C discharge rate. Hence, 6 wt% of EG is added to pure PCM and analyzed its effect on temperature rise under different flow conditions. It is found that the Tmax of 46.3°C and ΔTmax of 2°C are obtained at the flow velocity of 0.14 m/s and the CPCM with 6 wt% EG performs better even at 0.04 m/s of flow velocity. Yiran Zheng et al. [239] proposed a combined liquid and PCM cooling BTMS for cooling the batteries during fast charging. The alternate flow of coolant is passed through cooling tubes and polyurethane adiabatic interlayers are introduced between cooling tubes to provide effective temperature uniformity. Results showed that the proposed cooling system can maintain the Tmax and ΔTmax at 38.69°C and 2.23°C respectively at an 8C charging rate. Limin Song et al. [240] numerically investigated PCM+liquid cooling and verified experimentally for the thermal performance of LIB. The numerical and experimental results are in sensible agreement and it is suggested that the proposed method can be implemented to actual battery model with nearly insignificant deviation for better thermal management. Rao et al. [241] numerically investigated the performance of a PCM coupled mini channel cold plate liquid cooling system. The proposed system provides a Tmax of 47.6°C but does not actively control the ΔTmax. A lot of research work can be done to improve the performance of the proposed system along with the experimental validations and weight and volume reduction. F. Bai et al. [242] numerically studied the effect of combining the cooling efficiency of liquid cooling and temperature uniformity of PCM cooling on thermal management of PCM+water-cooled Li-ion battery module. The proposed BTMS effectively controls the thermal performance of the battery module within the operating range during 5 continuous cycles and is capable of preventing TR. 4.6.1.3 HP integrated HTMS The heat pipes are coupled with various active cooling systems and also with passive PCM cooling to make the cooling more efficient. Z.Y. Jiang et al. [19] proposed a coupled heat pipe-PCM-based battery cooling system (Fig. 59 ) to examine the thermal response of commercial prismatic batteries during discharge/charge cycles. A lumped thermal model is constructed to solve the coupling heat transfer in the cooling structure of the HP/PCM system. Two PCMs/EG with different melting points are used. Results showed that the proposed system can maintain the longtime function of the battery module. It is suggested to keep the PCM melting temperature at least 3°C greater than the ambient temperature to ensure the complete recovery of the latent heat of PCM in every cycle. The proposed system and lumped thermal model can be effectively implemented to large battery packs of 100 or 1000 cells. TMS based on heat pipes with liquid cooling cold plates [243] for high power batteries is experimentally investigated for heat load up to 400 W. The proposed BTMS successfully dissipates 400 W per module keeping the cell temperature below 55°C, with 25°C water inlet temperature at 1 L/min flow rate. Weixiong Wu et al. [245] constructed a heat pipe + PCM based BTMS to combine the large heat storage capacity and excellent cooling of the PCM and heat pipe. The proposed system efficiently controls the Tmax of BTMS below 50°C and enhances the temperature uniformity amongst cells even at 5C discharge rate if the forced air convection is introduced at the end of the cooling system. Q. Wang et al. [244] discussed the effect of battery terminal direction, OHP position angle on a PCM+oscillating heat pipe (PCM+OHP)-based BTMS (Fig. 60 ) for a surrogate battery and compared with an OHP-cooled system. It is recommended that the start-up temperature of OHP should be less than the PCT of PCM and the battery terminals should be far from the adiabatic section of OHP. Also, the position of OHP has little effect on the system. Jiateng Zhao et al. [246] experimentally investigated the thermal performance of a PCM+OHP battery cooling system under different operating conditions. The results revealed that the working condition of OHP directly affects the thermal performance of the system. A wet cooling assisted heat pipe BTMS (Fig. 61 ) is experimentally investigated by Rui Zhao et al. [204] to consider the thermal surge of Li-ion batteries. Water sprays are used for wet cooling. The proposed system is an active method of cooling of batteries within operating temperatures. It is suggested that the water spray in wet cooling can be replaced by the micro channel cooling tubes for big size battery packs in industrial applications and EVs. L. Feng et al. [247] experimentally tested the thermal and strain management of 18,650 battery pack cooled with a heat pipe+forced-fin-air cooling system at different discharge rates. It is found that the temperature and strain of the battery increase with the increase in discharge rates. The rise in maximum temperature of battery pack rigged with heat pipe with fan drops from 53.3°C to 17.5°C and the maximum strain decreases by 75% as compared to the ambient cooling when the cycle test is at 1C discharge rate. A heat pipe heat exchanger and heat pump air conditioning cooling system is designed by Huiming Zou et al. [248] for cabinet cooling of a regular 5-chair electric car. The results showed that this integrated cooling system also provides 20% additional cooling to cool battery packs without increasing input power supply. Qiqiu Huang et al. [195] experimentally investigated thermal management of cylindrical 18,650 LIB module with pure PCM, PCM+HP+Air, PCM+HP+Liquid cooling systems at different discharge rates. The results concluded that HP+PCM+Liquid cooling is an effective solution for EVs. 4.6.1.4 Other hybrid BTMS Unlike the combination of conventional active and passive cooling systems, some researchers have integrated some novel techniques such as thermoelectric cooling, refrigeration cooling, mist cooling to develop a hybrid TMS. A novel technique of placing the battery cells in an inverted vertical position is proposed by Shashank Arora et al. [249] for enhancing the thermal conductivity of pure PCM. The proposed system can retain the battery temperature under control during stressful conditions of repetitive charge-discharge cycling and limited rest periods. Also, a thermoelectric cooler is introduced to recover the waste heat from PCM-matrix which puts a negative parasitic load on the battery pack. Y. Lyu et al. [250] investigated a combination of thermoelectric + forced air + liquid cooling thermal management systems. Detailed tests are performed on a simulated EV battery system and the results revealed a promising cooling effect with a fair dissipation of electricity. Besides, the experimental test showed that the battery surface temperature decreases by about 43°C (from 55°C to 12°C) using a single-cell TEC-based water cooling system. An integrated TMS (ITMS) vapor injection with battery heat dissipation is simulated, developed, and validated by Xinxin Han et al. [251]. Refrigerant R410a, air, and 50% ethylene glycol solution are injected as working fluid, and the effect of injection pressure, battery heat dissipation, and ambient temperature on heating performance is investigated. The results showed that as the heat dissipation rate rises from 1 kW to 3 kW at an ambient temperature of -20°C, the coefficient of performance (COP) and heating capacity are increase by 10.80% and 25.81% respectively. The air-flow model in conjunction with a pouch cell using vortex generator (VG) (Fig. 62 ) is proposed by Junling Xie et al. [252] and then performed a numerical simulation of delta winglet and rectangular rib VGs to investigate the thermal behavior & performance of the proposed model. Results showed that both the types of VGs can enhance heat transfer and reduce Tmax but the delta winglet gives better results than a rectangular rib. Wangyu Liu et al. [7] proposed a vapor chamber combined with a fin structure integrated forced-air cooling and water cooling systems for cylindrical battery pack. The vapor chamber comprises a micro channel Al flat tube filled with acetone. The proposed system enhances the effectiveness of the battery cooling system and compared to the vapor chamber system with forced-air cooling, water cooling is the most efficient method for BTM. Seonggi Park et al. [223] analyzed the cooling performances of the refrigerant-cooled and PCM cooled BTMSs under mild, stressful, and cyclic operating conditions. Numerical results showed that the refrigerant-cooled BTMS performs better within an ambient temperature range of 20–40°C and the overall comparison demonstrated that under mild and stressful operating conditions, both BTMSs works effectively whereas the refrigerant cooling system performs more effectively than PCM cooling under cyclic operating conditions. Wei et al. [253] proposed a hybrid cooling system (Fig. 63 ) which is a combination of the air-cooling duct and water cooling driven by capillary effect and compared it with no cooling and air-cooling conditions. The proposed hybrid cooling system exhibits greater thermal performance and cooling efficiency than no cooling and pure air cooling. It provides an improvement in cooling efficiency of 20 percent and an improvement in uniformity of 56 percent compared to air cooling with approximately no extra power consumption. It has been suggested that the hybrid cooling systems reported in literature achieve better thermal performance as compared to the individual BTMS and are promising solutions for enhancing the cooling efficiency of battery packs in electric vehicles. Table 6 gives a summary of the work reported in the literature about Hybrid BTMS. 4.7 Other battery cooling techniques Recent studies have been reported on the use of hydrogels, hydrogen cooled plates, vortex generators, thermoelectric coolers, etc. for the thermal management of batteries and battery packs. Thermoelectric cooling (TEC) based BTMS has been developed for years for vehicles but is a novel technology for EVs which is based on thermoelectric potential difference. This thermoelectric effect is comprised of Peltier–Seebeck effect and the Thompson effect. Literature indicates that TEC use for BTMS is insufficient because of the poor thermal efficiency and novelty of the TEC applications. Chakib Alaoui et al. [254,255] have conducted studies on TEC-based battery cooling for EVs and HEVs and stated that the maximum temperature can be kept below 55°C. Few studies [256,257] have also been conducted on TEC integrated with air and water cooling systems for EVs. Future directions are also focused on TEC based BTMS to achieve higher thermal efficiency and more heat dissipation from Li-ion batteries in EVs. Some of the studies conducted on it are summarized in the subsequent text. 4.7.1 Experimental and Numerical analysis of other BTMS There are a few other cooling techniques that can be applied for battery cooling which were not explored much earlier are enlisted in the literature and investigated by some researchers. Hamid Jannesari et al. [258] proposed a potassium polyacrylate hydrogel-based BTMS for a cylindrical LiFePO4 battery pack. Testing is performed for battery pack without hydrogel and with hydrogel filling between the cell spaces only (Fig. 64 (a)) and into the entire battery pack (Fig. 64(b)). Results showed that the maximum temperature drop using hydrogel within the battery pack is 3.9°C, 7.5°C, and 10.9°C at 1C, 2C, and 3C discharge rates respectively whereas no significant difference is found in temperature uniformity with or without using hydrogel. It also revealed that the use of hydrogel to reduce the battery pack temperature is more effective than increasing the distance between the cells. Sijie Zhang et al. [259] experimentally and numerically investigated the effects of using sodium polyacrylate hydrogel on the thermal performance of a 4S1P 3 Ah Li-ion battery pack under different discharge currents. The proposed hydrogel-based BTMS excels the thermal performance of the battery pack even at a high discharge rate of 10 A. Also, a lower capacity fading rate (2.07 mAh/cycle) and a more safe operational temperature range are achieved by implementing hydrogel. The hydrogen cooled Al cold plate is designed by Maan Al-Zareer et al. [260] to enhance the cooling efficiency of fuel cell vehicles. The results showed that the hydrogen cooling system positively holds the Tmax at 30°C and ΔTmax as 6.4°C which is out of the desired value of 5°C. Further studies can be carried out to achieve uniform temperature within the battery module. Bittagopal Mondal et al. [261] studied the effects of vortex generators on the heat transfer characteristics in the cooling channel of a BTMS using the lithium-ion simulation software Battery Design Studio (BDS) along with CFD. The inclusion of vortex generators to the BTMS increases the heat transfer of the cooling channel as well as reduces the Tmax and ΔTmax. Lip Huat Saw et al. [262] experimentally and numerically investigated the thermal performance of a novel mist cooling system (Fig. 65 ) for a battery pack and compared it with dry air cooling. The study concluded that mist cooling is an effective alternative for a liquid cooling system as it efficiently controls the temperature rise and temperature variation of battery packs within the operating range. The literature survey disclosed that very few research studies have been conducted on such techniques and their application to the battery cooling system of EVs. The performance of these methods can be enhanced by integrating them with any conventional cooling methods.", "output": {}}

Herein, we developed Z-scheme MgO/TiO2/g-C3N4 ternary heterojunction photocatalyst with surface defects and effective charge separation for reduction of recalcitrant dinitrobenzene isomers under simulated solar light irradiation. Mott-Schottky (MS) plot analysis and electron spin resonance (ESR) radical trapping experiment suggested the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction at the interface of TiO2/g-C3N4, which played a crucial role in the electron-hole separation. Incorporating MgO into the structure further enhances charge separation via Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy (OV) defects formation at the TiO2/MgO interface as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental programs 2.1 Raw materials The cement used in the experiment is type I ordinary Portland cement produced by Shandong Lucheng Cement Co. Ltd. The chemical composition of cement is shown in Table 1. TiO2 is available in three different crystal types: Anatase, plate titanium and rutile[8,9]. In order to avoid agglomeration of nanoparticles and affect the dispersion of TiO2 in cement system and reduce the cost, the nano-TiO2 particles used in the experiment are anatase crystals (as shown in Fig. 1), produced by Hebei Xingtai Metallic Materials Co. Ltd. in China, with an average particle size of 800 nm and a purity of no less than 99.5%, which are hydrophilic particles. Additionally, the particle size distribution of Portland cement is shown in Fig. 2. 2.2 Sample preparation To investigate the effects of nano-TiO2 content on the hydration process, photocatalytic activity and antibacterial properties of cement paste, this paper designed the mix ratio of three groups of cement-based composite materials, the details are shown in Table 2. It was found that when studying the effects of different amounts of nano-TiO2 on cement hydration and photocatalytic properties, the amount of titanium dioxide was mostly 0∼10%. For example, Victor et al. [10] had studied the influence of different nano-titanium dioxide content (3%, 6% and 10%) on cement properties. The effect of nano-TiO2 (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10%) on physical and mechanical properties and photocatalytic efficiency of concrete have been investigated by Pei et al. [11]. Therefore, in this paper, the water-cement ratio of cement paste is fixed at 0.4, and nano-TiO2 replaces 0, 5% and 10% of cement mass, respectively. The preparation process of cement paste is shown in Fig. 3. First weigh the quantity of the solid powder (cement and nano-TiO2). To prevent nano-TiO2 from agglomerating, it is necessary to conduct ultrasonic treatment on the uniformly mixed cement and TiO2. Subsequently, pour the ultrasonic treated powder into the mixer, slowly add the water in the process of low speed mixing, and stir for 1 min. Finally, the evenly mixed mixture was injected into a 40×40×160 mm plastic mold and maintained at 95%±5% humidity and 25℃ until the test age. 2.3 Test methods 2.3.1 Hydration heat The hydration heat of cement was measured by TAM-AIR eight-channel microcalorimeter produced by TA Company. In the experiment process, nano-TiO2 and cement were first mixed evenly, then solid powder and deionized water were injected into ampoules, quickly mixed evenly and tested. The temperature of cement hydration heat test has been maintained at 25 ℃. The mass of cement used in each hydration heat experiment was 4 g, the mass of TiO2 was 0, 0.2 g and 0.4 g, respectively, and the test duration was 72 h. 2.3.2 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy In this paper, the electrochemical test of cement-based composites was carried out by using Coster CS single-channel electrochemical workstation. In the experimental process, the homogeneous mixture in \"2.2 Sample preparation\" was firstly injected into a 40×40×160 mm plastic mold, and the two homemade electrodes were fixed vertically in the mold (as shown in Fig. 4). The voltage and frequency ranges used during testing were 30 mv and 1 Hz∼1 MHz, respectively. 2.3.3 Determination by ultraviolet spectrophotometer To study the photocatalytic efficiency of the cement paste doped with nano-TiO2, the ultraviolet spectrophotometer of LAMBDA365 (Perkinelmer Enterprise Management Co., Ltd.) was used to carry out the photocatalytic experiment, and the methylene blue (MB) degradation rate was measured to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the cement paste. Deuterium lamp was used as photocatalytic light source, and methylene blue (MB) solution with initial concentration of 10 mg/L was used as photocatalytic degradation object. During the test, three kinds of newly mixed cement paste samples were diluted to 0.01% of the original concentration with deionized water. After darkening the samples for 20 min, the methylene blue concentration was determined at 5 min intervals in the range of 250–700 nm, and the test time was 20 min. The intensity of the lamp is 0.89 W/m2, and the distance between the lamp source and the sample is 20 cm. The photocatalytic activity of cement-based materials was evaluated by the change of methylene blue solution concentration, and the photocatalytic efficiency R was expressed by Eq. (1): (1) R = C 0 − C C 0 × 100 % Where R is the photocatalytic degradation rate of the sample; C 0 is the concentration of MB solution (mg/L) of the sample before catalysis; and C is the concentration of MB solution (mg/L) of the sample under UV light at the specified time. 2.3.4 Antibacterial performance test Bacillus subtilis was used as the test strain. After 5 g Bacillus subtilis was evenly mixed with 100 mL water, it was inoculated on three kinds of newly mixed cement paste, in which the size of Bacillus subtilis was 5×108 organisms/g. Meanwhile, the concentration of bacteria was detected by enzyme labeling analyzer. The Φ100 mm cell culture dish was placed in a constant temperature incubator at 37 ℃ for 24 h, and then taken out to observe the bacterial growth, and the bacterial concentration was detected by enzyme labelling analyser at the same time. The enzyme label plate and enzyme label analyzer are shown in Fig. 5. After 24 h, the supernatants of different samples were filtered and added into the microtiter wells of the enzyme plate by pipette gun. The absorbance D600 was measured at 600 nm, and the amount of each hole was 250 μL. The average value of eight groups of each sample was determined.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "cement paste", "Syns_method": "cement paste preparation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "cement", "amount": "100% (base)"}, "prc2": {"name": "nano-TiO2", "amount": "0%, 5%, 10% of cement mass"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "0.4 (water-cement ratio)"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ultrasonic treatment", "substance": [{"name": "cement and TiO2 mixture"}]}, "post_proc2": {"step": "mixing", "parameters": {"time": "1 min"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "curing", "parameters": {"temperature": "25 °C", "humidity": "95%±5%"}}}}}}}

The active materials (LFP and LCO, NCM811), Super P, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were used as received.\nThe synthetic process of SPE is plotted in Fig. 1a. Typically, 0.5 g of P(VDF-HFP) was dissolved in 5 g of THF to form a homogeneous solution under magnetic stirring. Then, C6M, IL and LiTFSI were added to the precursor solution, and 0.015 g of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone was also added as a photoinitiator. This mixture was casted onto a polytetrafluoroethylene mold. Ultraviolet light (365 nm) was used to trigger the polymerization of C6M. Finally, as-obtained flexible film was dried at 80 °C in vacuum overnight, which was referred as P-PLC-IL. For a comparison, a mixture without UV light to form an electrolyte was named P-LC-IL and a mixture without IL to form an electrolyte was named P-PLC. A P(VDF-HFP) -based electrolyte without C6M was also prepared by an identical process and is referred to as P-IL. In contrast, a P(VDF-HFP) membrane was prepared without any additive (named P(VDF-HFP)).\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a N2 atmosphere on a STA7200RV instrument from 20 °C to 600 °C with a heating time of 1 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected by a Rigaku XRD (40 kV, 40 mA) with a scan angle from 5° to 80°. The morphologies were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-7001F) with 5 kV electron energy and a 10 μA sample current with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected in a Thermo Nicolet AVATAR 360 from 4000 to 500 cm−1.\nElectrochemistry analysis details are supplied in the Section 1 of the ESI.†\nAll calculations were performed by density functional theory (DFT) in Gaussian 09 software.45,46 The structures were optimized using the M06-2X theoretical combined with the 6-31+G(d, p) basis set. In the optimizing process, cations and ion pairs relaxed the symmetry constraint, while anions were considered in the structural symmetry. All of the obtained geometries were confirmed by frequency to ensure no imaginary frequencies. In these calculations, the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set was stressed because it is of double-ξ quality for valence electrons with a certain consideration of diffuse functions. The initial configurations of the ion pairs were mainly based on the charge distribution and electrostatic potential on the isolated cation and anion. The interaction energies (E1, E2) were calculated by the following eqn (1).E1 = E(Li+) + E(TFSI−) − E(LiTFSI) (1)E2 = E(C6M-Li+) + E(C6M-TFSI−) −E(C6M-LiTFSI) − E(C6M). (2)\nSLMBs that consisted of a lithium metal anode, LFP, LCO or NCM811 cathode and an SPE were assembled in inert environments. For the cathodes, the active materials (LFP, LCO and NCM811, 80 wt%), Super P (10 wt%), and PVDF (10 wt%) were mixed in NMP. After being stirred for 2 h, the slurries were cast onto a carbon-coated aluminum foil. The mass loading of LFP was about 2.5 mg cm−2. The mass loading of LCO was about 2.0 mg cm−2. For the Li/LFP batteries, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were investigated by a CHI604A under a 0.1 mV s−1 scan rate with a voltage range of 2.5 to 4.0 V. The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles and charge/discharge cycles of the assembled SLMBs were investigated by a LAND CT2001A battery test system, where 1C was equal to 170 mA g−1, at different temperatures. The batteries were pre-cycled at RT for two cycles before testing at 100 °C. For the Li/LCO batteries, the voltage ranges were settled in 3–4.2 V (1C = 150 mA g−1), and the voltage range was settled in 3–4.3 V (1C = 200 mA g−1) for the Li/NCM811 batteries.\n", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "P-PLC-IL", "Syns_method": "solution casting with UV polymerization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "P(VDF-HFP)", "amount": "0.5 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone", "amount": "0.015 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C4H8O", "amount": "5 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "polymerize", "parameters": {"light": "UV 365 nm"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "P-LC-IL", "Syns_method": "solution casting", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "P(VDF-HFP)", "amount": "0.5 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C4H8O", "amount": "5 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "P-PLC", "Syns_method": "solution casting with UV polymerization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "P(VDF-HFP)", "amount": "0.5 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone", "amount": "0.015 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C4H8O", "amount": "5 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "polymerize", "parameters": {"light": "UV 365 nm"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C"}}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "P-IL", "Syns_method": "solution casting", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "P(VDF-HFP)", "amount": "0.5 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C4H8O", "amount": "5 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C"}}}}}, "MAT5": {"name": "P(VDF-HFP)", "Syns_method": "solution casting", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "P(VDF-HFP)", "amount": "0.5 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C4H8O", "amount": "5 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "With increasing urbanization and industrialization there is an upsurge in air pollution that demands immediate attention. The use of nanomaterials to alleviate air pollution is gaining importance. Certain nanomaterials can photocatalytically act on air pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulfur (SOx), and carbon (CO2), thereby bringing down their concentration locally. Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), its composites, and TiO2 based Z/S scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are a few such nanomaterials. The band-gap of TiO2 in solid-state (3.2 eV) makes it a good photocatalyst in the ultraviolet region and its composites in the visible light region of the spectrum. Metropolitan cities are densely filled with high-rise buildings and the exteriors of these buildings, which are largely exposed to the atmosphere, can be utilized to coat these nano materials to enable photocatalytic reduction of air pollutants in the surrounding atmosphere. The nano photocatalysts can either be applied as coatings on the existing buildings or incorporated into the construction materials during construction. In this review article, an attempt is made to cover the application of photocatalysts in the construction industry starting from the working principle (mechanism) of heterogeneous and heterojunction photocatalysts, their advantages and disadvantages, methods of synthesis, pollution control applications, with emphasis on the methods of incorporating the photocatalysts into construction materials and also as a coating on existing buildings, the set up required to evaluate NOx reduction and the factors that affect the NOx reduction.

First, 0.1 g of PEG were dissolved in 40 mL of NaOH solution (1 mol/L); 0.22 g of Cu(NO3)2·3 H2O and 1 mL of TiCl4 were dissolved together in 20 mL of deionized water under stirring. Second, the mixed solution of Cu(NO3)2·3 H2O and TiCl4 was added dropwise to NaOH solution under stirring at room temperature, after that, the temperature was heated up to 40 °C and the mixture was stirred for another 1 h to obtain white suspension. Third, after the suspension was stood for 24 h at room temperature, the sediments were filtered out and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. Finally, the filter cake was calcined at 600 °C for 2 h in air atmosphere to obtain TiO2/CuO NPs. TiO2 NPs were also synthesized using the above method, except that no Cu(NO3)2·3 H2O were dissolved in deionized water. 2.3 Preparation of the PBST/TiO2/CuO (PTC) composite films PBST was synthesized by the method reported previously (Luo et al., 2010). Firstly, TPA, SA, and 1,4-BD (moral ratio = (7: 3): 2) were mixed together in a three-necked flask. 0.5 % (moral ratio based on mixture) drops of catalyst TTiPO were added into the mixed solution under 90 °C. Then, it was continuously heated to 215 °C for 2 h until the limpid solution was obtained. After that, the solution was further heated for another 1 h under 230 °C for esterification. Finally, the futher reaction was carried out under vacuum conditions at 245 °C for another 2 h, the final products were obtained by dissolving in chloroform and precipitating by methanol. PBST-based nanocomposite films were prepared via the solvent casting method. 1 g of PBST and a various amount of TiO2 or TiO2/CuO NPs (0/1/3/5/7/9 wt % based on PBST) were added to 15 mL of chloroform. The above mixture was constantly stirred for 24 h at room temperature and sonicated for 1 h to form well-dispersed suspensions, then the film-forming solutions were casted on leveled glass plate, after standing for 24 h at room temperature to vaporize the solvent, the PBST/TiO2 and PBST/TiO2/CuO nanocomposite films were prepared. Nanocomposite films abbreviation and corresponding proportion of materials were listed in Table S1. 2.4 Characterization of composites film 2.4.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis An X-ray diffractometer (D/max2500p: 40 kV and 150 mA, Rigaku, Japan) equipped with Nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) was used to record X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the TiO2/CuO NPs and PTC films, which was analyzed at the 2θ range of 10–80° with a scan rate of 4° min−1. The crystallinity degree (X c) was calculated using following equation: (1) X c = ( A t o t a l − A a m o r p h o u s ) A t o t a l × 100 % where A total is total area (crystalline and amorphous peaks area), A amorphous is area of the amorphous peaks (Wei et al., 2016). 2.4.2 UV-Vis analysis UV-Vis light barrier properties of films and optical absorbance of TiO2/CuO NPs were tested by a UV-1800 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shanghai Precision Instrument, China) with the wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm. 2.4.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Morphological and microstructural measurements were performed by scanning electron microscopy (S-4800, Hitachi Co, Japan) at 5 kV. The surface of the sample was treated with gold. 2.4.4 FT-IR spectroscopy analysis The films were characterized via FTIR-Spectroscopy (Nicolet 380, American Thermoelectric, USA), the FTIR spectra were obtained by scanning the composite film samples at room temperature with a scanning range of 400–4000 cm−1 and resolution of 4 cm−1. 2.4.5 DSC measurement The DSC measurement was done with the help of the Perkin-Elmer-8000 machine to analyze the thermal and crystallization properties of the PTC films, the analysis was performed in the three-stage process: 3 mg of samples were placed in an aluminium crucible and firstly heated from − 20–200 °C, held for 2 min to erase thermal history, then cooled to − 20 °C to obtain crystallization curves, finally heated to 200 °C once again to get melting curves, the entire process was protected by N2 and the rate of heating and cooling processes was kept at 20 °C min−1. Each sample was tested three times. 2.4.6 Thermogravimetric analysis The thermal stability of films was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA 4000, PerkinElmer, USA) at a heating rate of 25 °C min−1 from 20 °C to 70 °C under nitrogen atmosphere (20 mL min−1). The sample mass was in the range of 7–15 mg. The derivative form of TGA (DTG) was obtained using the differentials of TGA values, which were calculated using a central finite difference method (Shankar & Rhim, 2015). At least 3 tests were repeated for each sample. 2.4.7 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of films with a size of 20 mm × 50 mm were performed using Universal Testing Machine (YC-125, Shanghai Yuhan Machinery, China) according to ISO 527–3. The gauge length is 30 mm and the stretching speed was 5 mm min−1. Each sample was tested at least five times. Elastic modulus (EM) was calculated according to Eq. (2): (2) E M = S t r e s s S t r a i n the values of stress and strain were taken from any point on the tangent of initial linear portion of the stress/strain curve (Goudarzi & Shahabi-Ghahfarrokhi, 2018). 2.4.8 Water vapor permeability The WVP of the films was measured by the cupping method according to the ASTM F1249, the glass dishes with 15.0 g of calcium chloride anhydrous were encased with PTC films, and the total mass of the glass dishes were recorded. Then placed the glass dishes in a dry kettle with saturated NaCl solution at the bottom, standing for 24 h at room temperature, and weighed the total mass afterwards. The overall system was kept at an environment of 25 ± 1 °C and 50 % RH. Each sample was tested at least five times to obtain final values. The WVP values were calculated by applying the Eq. (3): (3) W V P = Δ m × e t × S × P where Δm (g) is the total mass change of the glass dishe within time t (s), e (m) is the film thickness, P (Pa) is the saturation pressure, and S (m2) is the available separation region of the film. 2.4.9 Antibacterial activities The antibacterial activity of the films was determined using the total viable colony count method. The purchased bacteria were cultured in conical bottles containing 50 mL of Luria-Bertani broth for 24 h at 37 °C in a thermostatic oscillator. 6 mL of bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 5000 r min−1 for 5 min. The upper cleaning fluid was removed, the precipitation was diluted with PBS buffer solution and cultured for another 24 h with the same steps. After that, the precipitation was diluted with PBS buffer to 104 CFU mL−1. 200 μL of diluted bacterial suspension were dropped on the surface of the films (3 cm × 3 cm). After incubated for 24 h in an oven at 37 °C, the films were repeatedly rinsed by 2 mL PBS buffer. Then 15 μL of the above liquid were taken and coated evenly over the solid medium. The solid medium was prepared with 3.3 g of nutrient agar and 100 mL of deionized water. The numbers of colonies were recorded after coated petri dish being incubated for 24 h in an oven at 37 °C. The inhibition rate ( %) was defined by the Eq. (4): (4) I n h i b i t i o n R a t e ( % ) = M − N M × 100 % where M is the total mass of colonies on PTC-0, N is the total mass of colonies on antibacterial films. 2.4.10 Cherry tomato preservation experiment Cherry tomatoes were chosen as the experimental subject and packaged one by one. Cherry tomatoes, raw and wrapped with PTC-0, PTC-3 and PTC-9 films, were labeled as No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 using a marking pen, respectively. The labeled cherry tomatoes were stored in constant temperature incubator at 37 °C. Then the cherry tomatoes were taken out to observe their surface morphology and their weights were also recorded every six days. All experimental operations were conducted in a sterile room. The weight loss rate (%) was calculated using the following equation: (5) W e i g h t L o s s R a t e ( % ) = α − β α × 100 % where α is the weight of the fresh cherry tomatoes and β is the weight of the preserved cherry tomatoes. The firmness of cherry tomatoes that had been stored in the oven for 6, 12 and 18 days was determined with a texture analyzer (EZ-LX, SHIMADZU, Japan) with 30 % deformation and a 5 mm diameter cylindrical probe at the speed of 0.5 mm s−1. 5 tests for each sample were performed to determine the reproducibility. Then, the above cherry tomatoes were immersed into 100 mL of sterile peptone (0.1 % w/v) and stirred slowly for 2 min 15 μL of the above liquid were took and coated evenly over the solid medium and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. The total colony count on the surface of the film was expressed as CFU g−1. 2.4.11 Statistical analysis The performance tests of all the films was made in triplicate and the date were presented as means ± standard deviation. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed.

Samples were dispersed using ultrasonic for 30 min. Then, tribological properties were examined via a ball-on-disk tribometer (TSN-WTC 01, TSN Company) at room temperature. The 100Cr6 bearing steel was used as the ball (diameter in 1 cm) and disk [19, 21]. All balls and disks were cleaned with acetone in an ultrasonic bath and dried before testing to prevent contamination. Friction tests were accomplished at a constant load (5 N), rotating speeds (100 rpm) and linear velocity (0.20944 m/s) for 80 min [19, 21]. Each test was duplicated three times with similar test conditions. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of the wear test. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the tribological test consists of one ball and one disc. The direction of loading force is shown on the disc as well as the direction of rotation. Base oil samples with and without Fe3O4/TiO2 additives were used. The friction test was performed according to the mentioned conditions. Amounts of wear scar width were determined by an optical microscope (Olympus BX 60 M). The morphology and the state of the elemental chemical valence of the wear scar scopes lubricant with Fe3O4/TiO2 additives (optimal sample) were investigated via scanning electron microscopes (SEM, TE-SCAN Company, MIRA3) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Bes Tec XPS system, Germany).\nTable 1 Chemical and physical chemical properties of base oil [8, 21, 30]\nFull size table\nFig. 2\nSchematic diagram of tribological tests\nFull size image", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Fe3O4", "Syns_method": "co-precipitation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "FeCl2·4H2O", "amount": "0.0075 mol"}, "prc2": {"name": "FeCl3·6H2O", "amount": "0.015 mol"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "90 °C", "time": "6 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "magnetic isolate"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "50 °C", "time": "14 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Fe3O4/TiO2", "Syns_method": "Stöber method and hydrolysis-condensation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe3O4", "amount": "0.1 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "NH4OH", "amount": "2.5 mL"}, "prc3": {"name": "TEOS", "amount": "0.25 mL"}, "prc4": {"name": "TBOT", "amount": "0.3 mL"}, "prc5": {"name": "HPC", "amount": "0.3 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "1 part"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "4 parts"}, "sov3": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "180 mL"}, "sov4": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "0.36 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "magnetic isolate", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "washed with distilled water and ethanol"}]}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "14 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "85 °C", "time": "90 min"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "50 °C", "time": "6 h"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}}}

No further purification process was carried out. The functionalization of the purchased CNT product (Shenzhen Turing Evolution Technology Co., Ltd) was carried out using a 3:1 (v/v) mixture of concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3 acids at 60 °C stirring for 3 days and subsequently sonicated for 30 min to obtain FCNT suspension. Metal iron foils were polished with an abrasive paper carefully and washed with diluted ethanol solution (50 vol%) for several times. Then the iron foils were immersed completely by the obtained diluted FCNT suspension (60 mL, approx. 2.2 mg·mL−1). The reaction system was sealed in a 100 mL PTFE liner and maintained at 180 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, the reaction system was ultrasonicated and remove the iron foils. After repetitively ultrasonication and centrifugation with de-ionized water several times, the Fe2O3@Fe3O4/CNT sample was collected through a freeze-drying process. A Fe2O3@Fe3O4 controlled sample was synthesized following the same steps as above with de-ionized water instead of FCNT suspension. Due to the low productivity, this sample was obtained by gathering several batches of product. The Fe3O4/CNT controlled sample was fabricated by further annealing the Fe2O3@Fe3O4/CNT sample in a tube furnace under Ar atmosphere at 700 °C for 2 h. 2.2 Sample characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV) with a Cu-Kα radiation of λ = 0.15418 nm and the scanning speed was 10°/min with a grazing angle of 5°. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7800F) with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) accessory and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100Plus) were used to investigate the microstructures of the prepared samples. A Renishaw inVia Plus Micro-Raman spectroscopy system equipped with a 50 mW DPSS laser at 532 nm was used to record Raman spectra of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured using a PHI Quantera II spectrometer with compressed samples pasted on a testing platform. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were characterized by an Autosorb-IQ-MP/XR surface area and pore analyzer (Quantachrome). The specific surface areas of samples were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model based on N2 adsorption data. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to determine the content of components by a thermal gravimetric analyzer (Mettler Toledo TGA-2) in air with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1 from 25 °C to 800 °C. 2.3 Lithium-ion storage measurement Electrochemical active products, carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed in a mass ratio of 8:1:1, then the formed slurry was pasted on a copper foil and dried as working electrodes. A Celgard 2600 film was used as a separator between the working electrode and metal lithium counter electrode. A solution with 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/ethylene methyl carbonate (EC/DMC/EMC) with a volumetric ratio of 1:1:1 was used as electrolyte. Coin-type cells were fabricated to investigate the lithium-ion storage property of the fabricated samples, including galvanostatic charge/discharge (Neware battery testing system), cyclic voltammetry (CV, CHI 660D), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, CHI 660D), pseudocapacitance behavior analysis (PGSTAT302N Autolab). The specific capacities were evaluated based on the weight of the composite material on the current collector. 2.4 Fenton degradation measurement The catalytic degradation experiments were performed in a 150 mL beaker and were carried out at 25 °C without pH adjustment. Based on the pre-experiments, the Fe2O3@Fe3O4/CNT sample (40 mg) was well dispersed in an MO aqueous suspension (40 mg·mL−1, 100 mL) under stirring. Then the suspension was stirred for 30 min to achieve the adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the catalyst and MO contaminant. The catalytic reaction was initiated when 400 µL of 30% H2O2 was dropped into the suspension. One milliliter suspension was collected and diluted a certain multiple at given time intervals followed by centrifugation immediately to remove the solid catalyst. The MO concentrations in the supernatant were determined at the wavelength of 463 nm through a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Nicolet IS50). For comparison, the Fe3O4/CNT was used instead of Fe2O3@Fe3O4/CNT for degradation of MO under the same conditions. The reusability was examined by repeated use of Fe2O3@Fe3O4/CNT for the catalytic degradation of MO. From one cycle to the next, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and rinsed with distilled water. Both tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and methanol (Me) were used as scavengers for HO• radical, which was dispersed into the Fenton oxidation system to evaluate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for MO degradation.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Fe2O3@Fe3O4/CNT", "Syns_method": "heat", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "FCNT", "amount": "132 mg"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "60 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "180 °C", "time": "6 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ultrasonication"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "centrifugation"}, "post_proc4": {"step": "freeze-drying"}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Fe2O3@Fe3O4", "Syns_method": "heat", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe foil"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "60 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "180 °C", "time": "6 h"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "Fe3O4/CNT", "Syns_method": "annealing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe2O3@Fe3O4/CNT"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "700 °C", "time": "2 h", "atmosphere": "Ar"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Material and methods 2.1 Sample preparation and surface modification 2.1.1 Sample preparation HOC-Ti disk specimens with a 0.62 % mass fraction of oxygen were prepared by the powder metallurgy method as described in a previous study. The specimens were polished with SiC papers (600, 1200, 2000 and 2500 grit) under water and were ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min in alcohol and deionized water after polishing. All samples were sterilized by autoclaving. CP-Ti (Grade 4) was used as a control. 2.1.2 Anodic oxidation treatment for the sample surface The sample of the NT group was anodized for 1 h in a fresh electrolyte containing 0.5 wt% hydrofluoric acid (HF). The external electro field was supplied at 20 V with DC power, and a graphite electrode was set as the cathode. The surfaces of samples belonging to the SLA group were treated as previously described. 2.1.3 Composition and characteristics of the specimen surface The composition of the sample surface was confirmed by XRD (Bruker, D8 ADVANCE, Germany). The morphology of the sample was inspected by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi, S-4800, Japan). The 3D topography and surface roughness of the sample were evaluated using atomic force microscopy (AFM 5500, Agilent, USA) in tapping mode. Contact angle measurements were performed to study the hydrophobicity of the sample surface using a contact angle goniometer (Kruss FM40, EasyDrop, Hamburg, Germany). The nanoscale mechanical properties of the HOC-NT and CP-NT surfaces were measured through nanoindentation methods(Bruker, Hysitron TI 980 Nanoindenter, Germany). The rates of loading and unloading were both 40 mN/min, and the holding time was 10 s under the maximum applied force of 10 mN. 2.1.4 Electrochemical performance of the sample The HOC-Ti and CP-Ti were processed into 10 × 10 × 1 mm3 specimens. After polishing and ultrasonic cleaning, oil-resistant silica gel was used to seal the part except the electrochemical reaction zone. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit potential (OCP) of the material were tested in 0.5 wt% HF solution using an electrochemical workstation (Princeton, Versa STAT 4). The test signal of EIS was a sine wave with an amplitude of 10 mV, and the test frequency range was 10 mHz-100 kHz. The test was carried out at the self-corrosion potential. The test parameters of the polarization curves of the samples were as follows: the detection potential was −0.25 V to 0.5 V, and the scanning rate was 1 mV/s. 2.2 The biocompatibility of MC3T3 and MLO-Y4 cells 2.2.1 Protein adsorption The samples were placed in α-MEM containing 10 % FBS and incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO₂ saturation for 2 h. After dissociating the proteins adsorbed on the sample surface with Triton-X 100, a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime) was used to quantify the protein concentration following the manufacturer's protocol. 2.2.2 Cell culture Osteoblast cell lines in bone tissue, including osteoblasts and osteocytes, could respond to dental implant stimulation and regulate osseointegration [27] (Fig. 12). The embryonic osteoblast cell line MC3T3 and osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37 °C in α-MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 500 U ml−1 penicillin and 500 μg ml−1 streptomycin. To induce osteoblastic differentiation, MC3T3 cells were cultured in osteogenic induction medium (OI) containing 100 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 nM dexamethasone and 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate. 2.2.3 Cell attachment and migration Both MC3T3 and MLO-Y4 cells were inoculated on the sample surface at a density of 1*105 cells/cm2 and cultured normally. After 24 h and 36 h of culture, the attached cells were fixed with 2.5 % w/v glutaraldehyde at 4 °C overnight. After dehydration in a graded series of ethanol (50, 70, 80, 90 and 100 vol%) for 30 min each and treated with a dryer, the samples were coated with Au. The cells were observed by SEM. Once the MC3T3 and MLO-Y4 cell layers reached confluence, the monolayer was scratched with a 5 ml pipette tip to create a vertical cell-free gap. Then, the cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 1 % FBS to detect the cell migration ability. At each time point, the cells adhered to the sample were stained with Hoechst (Beyotime, China) and scanned by fluorescence microscopy. The scratch area was measured by ImageJ software, and the wound healing rate was calculated. The formula was: 1 − scratch area / initial scratch area × 100 % 2.2.4 Cell viability and proliferation Cell viability was assessed via the CCK8 method. Both MC3T3 and MLO-Y4 cells were seeded at a density of 1*105 cells/cm2 on the samples. After culturing for 1, 3 and 7 days normally, the cells were cultured in mixed culture medium (medium: CCK-8 solution = 9:1). After 2 h, the supernatant was injected into a new 96-well plate with 200 μl per well to measure the OD values (450/650 nm). For the proliferation test, the cells on the sample surface were stained with Hoechst (Beyotime, China) after culturing for 1, 3 and 7 days normally. Immunofluorescence images were obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, FV1200, Japan), and the cell numbers were counted by using ImageJ software. 2.2.5 Cell differentiation ALP staining and ALP activity were used to analyze the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3 cells seeded on the sample surface after culturing in osteogenic medium for 7 and 14 days. ALP staining was performed using an ALP stain kit (Wako, 294–67,001, Japan) following the manufacturer's protocol. Then, the images of all samples were taken by a stereomicroscope (Leica). ALP activity was determined using the ALP Assay Kit (Beyotime) and standardized to the total protein concentration calculated with the BCA protein assay reagent (Beyotime). 2.2.6 Cell protein expression After culturing for 7 and 14 days in osteogenic medium, the total proteins in MC3T3 and MLO-Y4 cells were extracted using RIPA buffer to assay the total protein levels of GAPDH, actin, β-catenin, Rankl, OPG, YAP, Col-1 and sclerostin (Sost). The protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime) for equal loading. Protein was separated by 10 % SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were then incubated with specific antibodies and developed to show the protein of interest. Detailed information on the antibodies is shown in Table S1. 2.2.7 Coculture of MLO-Y4 and MC3T3 cells MLO-Y4 cells seeded on four different sample surfaces and MC3T3 cells were cultured in 6-well culture plates. The supernatant of MLO-Y4 cell culture medium was mixed with fresh osteogenic induction medium at a ratio of 1:2 to create four kinds of conditioned medium (CM). CM was used to induce osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3 cells. Normal osteogenic induction medium and normal culture medium were taken as the active control (AC) and negative control (NC), respectively. The MC3T3 cells were cultured in CM for 7 days and 14 days. ALP staining and ALP activity of MC3T3 cells were carried out. The expression levels of β-catenin, RUNX2, Rankl, OPG and Tubulin in MC3T3 cells were assayed by Western blot analysis. The experimental procedure and reagents were consistent with a previous experiment (2.2.6). Detailed information on each antibody is shown in Table S1. 2.3 Biocompatibility study in vivo 2.3.1 Surgical procedure The HOC-Ti and CP-Ti were prepared into dental implants (Fig. 1A) and treated with SLA and NT (Fig. 1B), respectively. The surface treatment methods were consistent with those previously described (Section 2.1.1). New Zealand white rabbits (5 months old, weighing 2.5–3.0 kg) were purchased from the Animal Experiments Center of AirForce Medical University (AFMU). All animal procedures were performed according to guidelines approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments of the Stomatology Hospital of AFMU (No. 2022-kq-031). General anesthesia was administered, and the metaphysis of the external condyle was labeled as the implant site (Fig. 1C). Implants with different surfaces were embedded after a 2.3 mm diameter hole was drilled gradually (Fig. 1E). The surgical wound was sutured in layers (Fig. 1D). Penicillin was administered intramuscularly for three days after the surgery. The rabbits were euthanized with an overdose injection of pentobarbital at each experimental time point postoperatively, and the samples containing the implant were obtained and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 48 h. 2.3.2 Evaluation of bone growth rate in sequential fluorescent labeling After implantation, the experimental animals were randomly divided into two observation groups. Triple fluorescence labeling was carried out to observe the speed and direction of osteogenesis around the implants. The injection time, sequence and doses are shown in Table 1 . The femurs containing the implant were harvested at each time point. The sample was cut with a hard tissue slicer (SP1600, Leica, German) along the axial and radial directions to take Sections 30 mm thick passing through the implant (Fig. 1F). The sections were observed by confocal laser microscope photography (Olympus, FV1200, Japan). The fluorescent color of the picture corresponding to the drug is shown in Table 1. 2.3.3 Osseointegration investigation To evaluate the formation of new bone, the fixed samples were scanned with a Micro X-ray 3D Imaging System (YXLON international GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) with the X-ray source set at a voltage of 90 kV and a current set at 44.4 μA. The scanning resolution was 12 μm, and the 3D structures of the samples were reconstructed. A cylindrical area surrounding the implant with a diameter of 500 μm and a length of 10 mm was defined as the region of interest (ROI) and calculated within VG Studio MAX (Volume Graphics, Germany). 2.3.4 Evaluation of protein expression in IHC/IHF staining After micro-CT scanning, the femur samples were decalcified in 10 % EDTA for 3 months. Then, the samples were dehydrated by serial ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Bone tissue Sections 4 μm thick were cut, followed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunohistofluorescence (IHF) staining of YAP and RUNX2. Detailed information on the antibodies is provided in Table S1. The slides were visualized microscopically (3DHISTECH, MINI II, Hungary). The images were analyzed quantitatively by ImageJ software. 2.4 Statistical analysis We used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyze continuous and normally distributed data and the Kruskal–Wallis H test for analysis of nonnormally distributed data. Shapiro–Wilk's test was used to assess the normality of the data. The least significant difference (LSD) tests were used for post hoc analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows software (version 19.0; SPSS Inc., USA).

The experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that the electron transfer process of Ti2+/Ti4+, Co2+/Co3+ and Fe3+/Fe2+, as well as the free radical and non-free radical attack behaviors produced by the adsorption of PMS by the composite, are the primary mechanisms for achieving rapid removal of pollutants. A comprehensive degradation mechanism and potential pathways were proposed based on these findings. Overall, CoFe2O4@Alk-MXene/PMS emerges as a promising catalytic system for TC removal.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "CoFe2O4@Alk-MXene", "application": "degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl)", "props": {"removal efficiency": "100 % @ 10 minutes"}}}}

This polymer separator has good flame retardant, strong mechanical properties, high thermal stability and high ion transmission efficiency. Unlike traditional ceramic modified separators, this hybrid separator is achieved by in situ nano-encapsulation hydrolysis. As a precursor of SiO2, Tetrabutyl orthosilicate (TBOS) is selected to coat on PI nanofibers surface, which endows a high retention rate of hydrolyzed silica and a dense/uniform coating. Due to the formation of silica nanoshell, the PI/SiO2 nanofiber separator shows an ultra-high 73.69 MPa tensile strength, a contact angle of only 6.8° and great thermal stability at 378 °C. The NCM811 half-cell equipped with composite separator shows a great capacity of 146 mAh·g−1 at 5C, which is much better than the battery using original PI separator and Celgard-2400 separator.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials The materials utilized for the experiments were of analytical grade and used without any further purification. Terephthalic acid (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) (H2BDC) was purchased from Avra Synthesis Pvt. Ltd with 98 % purity. Ammonium ceric nitrate (NH4)2 [Ce (NO3)6] was procured from NICE Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. Sabja seed was purchased from Carry Fresh grocery store. Dyes like Methylene blue, Congo red, naphthol B green, methyl orange, neutral red, acid fuchsin, Safranine MS, Chrysoidine Y, trypan blue, and, crystal violet was purchased from NICE Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. Solvents used for this experiment was purchased from Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd, India. Deionized water was used in all the experiments. 2.2 Synthesis of Ce-UiO-66 MOF The synthesis of Ce-UiO-66 MOF was followed by a similar procedure reported by [42]. Herein, 1.211 g (0.012 M) of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) was dissolved in 60 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF). To the above mixture, 4 g (0.5 M) of ammonium Ceric nitrate (NH4)2 [Ce (NO3)6] dissolved in deionized water (25 mL) was added. The mixture was heated at 110 °C for about 15–20 mins under continuous stirring conditions. The white solid obtained was further washed with the mother liquor before decanting. Further, the MOF was washed with DMF two times to remove the unreacted organic linkers and followed by methanol two times to remove the DMF from the pores of MOF. The resulting powder was dried at 70 °C overnight in a vacuum oven. 2.3 Synthesis of Ce-MOF incorporated natural seed bits To incorporate the Ce-UiO-66 MOF into the natural seeds, 20 mg of the MOF was dispersed in 20 mL of water and it was kept under continuous stirring in a beaker. To the resulting mixture, 100 mg of Basil (Sabja) seeds were added. The mixture was slowly stirred for up to 30 min to obtain a uniform coating. Herein, the MOF gets coated on the mucilage linkage through chemical bonding with the seed as the swelling of the seed takes place. According to the Zeta potential analysis, the basil seeds (SS) exhibit a negative charge of −43.4 mV, while the Ce-UiO-66 MOF displays a positive charge of +11.2 mV. Consequently, owing to their opposite charges, the probable interaction of the MOF particles with the basil seeds is observed to be through electrostatic interactions. The suspension of MOF-coated seeds was subjected to an additional water wash to remove any unbound MOF particles. Subsequently, the seeds were re-dispersed in 20 mL of water (Scheme 1 & video 1). The content of MOFs loaded (LC%) was calculated based on the weight percentage of the MOF incorporated into the basil seed's mucilage. This calculation was ascertained through the gravimetric analysis. Correspondingly, 20 mg of MOF exhibited a loading efficiency of 86.95 % with a MOF loading content of 13.28 % which is comparatively better than 10 mg, and 30 mg of MOF loaded into 100 mg of basil seeds (Fig. S1; equation S1 & S2; and table S1). 2.4 Characterization Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and Euromex optical microscope were used to determine the morphology of SS and CeSS. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy is used to determine the elemental mapping and composition. The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were determined at a scan rate of 2°/min with Rigaku Ultima IV which was operated at a wavelength of 1.54 Å using Cu-Kα radiation. The functional groups were analyzed using Perkin Elmer Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) between the wavenumber ranging from 4000 to 600 cm−1. the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm was analyzed through BET to determine the surface area and mean pore size. The thermal stability was studied through Thermo-gravimetry analysis (TGA) using N2 as the purge gas. The chemical state of the sample was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using VG multi-lab 2000 which is operated using an Al-Kα source. To determine the concentration of dyes UV–Vis spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-1800) was used.

Results demonstrate that pH (3.5–5.5) has a significant effect on the precipitation of metals (Fe, Al, Ni, Cu, Co, Mn, and Li), whereas higher temperature (T = 30 and 60 °C) decreases the precipitation pH of metals. Iron and aluminum were both found to precipitate at ca. pH 4 and the presence of aluminum in PLS clearly decreased the separation efficiency of Fe vs. active material metals (Ni, Co, Li). In the absence of dissolved aluminum, Fe precipitated already at pH 3.5 and did not result in the co-precipitation of other metals. Additionally, the Al-free slurry had a superior filtration performance. However, aluminum concentrations of 2 and 4 g/L were found to cause loss of Ni (2–10%), Co (1–2%) and Li (2–10%) to the Fe-Al hydroxide cake at pH 4. The use of LiOH (vs. NaOH) resulted in 50% lower co-precipitation of Ni, Co and Li.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "For the Paragraph2Compound task, we compiled an automatically annotated dataset. This dataset is based on the publicly accessed USPTO subset extracted by Lowe et al.,31,32 and includes millions of chemical reaction paragraphs from patents, each paired with compound tags. We used regular expressions to identify compound labels within each paragraph, separating them with the “|” symbol based on their sequential occurrence in the paragraph. For the Paragraph2RXNRole task, we used the manually annotated dataset by Guo et al.,8 following the same data partitioning strategy. We transformed the data from the BIO-token classification format into a sequence-to-sequence format using the annotation scheme “<Role*compound*Role>”. We processed paragraphs containing multiple central products and related reactions into several input and output pairs. For the Paragraph2MOFInfo task, we manually checked and re-annotated the raw data of Zheng et al.,14 transforming them into a sequence-to-sequence format. This dataset comprises MOF synthesis paragraphs, extraction by ChatGPT, and human-evaluated answers. For the Paragraph2NMR task, we manually curated a dataset of 600 high-quality annotations. These were mainly sourced from various literature studies on PubMed to ensure a wide diversity. The task aims to extract information such as the IUPAC name, experimental conditions, including the frequency and solvent, and chemical shift data from both 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra. For the Paragraph2Action task, we utilized the hand-annotated dataset by Vaucher et al., employing the same data partitioning strategy. This dataset is derived from the Pistachio dataset by NextMove software.33 The details of datasets used for the five chemical text mining tasks are listed in Table S1.†\nPrompt-only interaction enables users to efficiently communicate with large language models through simple prompts. This guides the model to produce relevant responses without further training. In a zero-shot scenario, the model generates responses using only a descriptive prompt and its pre-trained knowledge. However, in a few-shot approach, the model uses a small number of examples to improve its understanding and responses. To maximize the performance, we selected diverse examples and ensured a large number of tokens. We interacted with ChatGPT using API keys and employed model versions GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 and GPT-4-0613. The zero-shot and few-shot prompts for chemical text mining tasks can be found in Fig. S2–S8.†\nSince late August 2023, supervised fine-tuning capabilities have been available for the GPT-3.5-turbo model.34 The aim is to enhance performance in specific scenarios customized based on private data. In this study, we fine-tuned the GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 model for chemical text mining scenarios on five tasks. When discussing the performance in the Comparison of different methods for chemical text mining section, we fine-tuned the latest GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 model for fair comparison, which expanded the context length to 16 K and supported fine-tuning as well. We formatted the data into jsonl and uploaded them to OpenAI's cloud servers, and then initiated fine-tuning jobs. Once the training was complete, the fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo model was ready for inference. API keys were requisite throughout the training and inference procedures. Fine-tuning for the GPT-4-turbo model is not available now and is highly expected in the future.\nWe selected the most widely used and representative generative pre-trained language models such as Mistral,17 Llama3,18 Llama2,19 T5,20 and BART.21 These serve as baselines for a comprehensive comparison with the fine-tuned ChatGPT across five chemical text mining tasks. Considering performance, efficiency, and hardware resource constraints, we used full parameter fine-tuning for Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2 and Llama3-8b-instruct on 4 × 40 GB A100, and full parameter fine-tuning for BART-base and T5-base on 1 × 40 GB A100. We applied multitask-learning to BART and T5 in the Paragraph2MOFInfo task and Paragraph2NMR task due to their limitations in generating multi-attribute long sentences (Fig. S9 and S10†), aiming to enhance their performance. This approach significantly improved their performance. For Llama2, we used Q-LoRA35 to efficiently fine-tune llama2-13b-chat on 1 × 40 GB A100. This method maintains most of the performance of full parameter fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational demands. We used vllm36 to speed up the inference of LLMs such as Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2, Llama3-8b-instruct, and Llama2-13b-chat, which is tens of times faster than Hugging Face's pipeline. The inference of all fine-tuned models can run on 1 × 40 GB A100. To ensure optimal performance, we adjusted hyperparameters such as learning rates, lora_r, and lora_alpha during the fine-tuning process of baseline models (Table S2†). The hardware resources, memory cost, and runtimes of fine-tuning are provided for reference (Table S3†). More details of training, pre-processing, and post-processing can be found in the ESI.†\nSince fine-tuning ChatGPT does not allow for early stopping based on optimal validation loss, we report the performances of all models at the best epoch selected from the evaluation set for fair comparison. Given the task specifics, we use metrics including precision, recall, and F1 score for evaluating entity-level performance. For sentence-level performance assessment, we use Levenshtein similarity, exact match accuracy, partial accuracy, and a modified BLEU score.\n", "output": {}}

The cathode was prepared from slurry mixture of 100 wt% LMO, 5 wt% acetylene black, and 5 wt% polyvinylidene difluoride in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The cathode slurry was coated onto Ti foil and dried in 120 °C under vacuum. The cathode was pressed to obtain an electrode density of 2.2 g cm−3 and composed of 8.5 mg cm−2 and cut into a circular strip of 10 mm in diameter (LMO cathode). LTO from a commercial source was used as the anode active material since it exhibits insertion/extraction potential lower than that of other promising metal oxide anodes for LIBs. The anode was prepared from slurry mixture of 100 wt% LTO, 10 wt% Ketjen black, 10 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene in NMP. The anode slurry was coated onto Zn foil and dried in 120 °C under valuum. The anode electrodes were pressed to obtain an electrode density of 2.1 g cm−3 and composed of 1.5 mg cm−2 and cut into a circular strip of 10 mm in diameter (LTO anode). An SE with dimensions 1 in. × 1 in. and thickness 150 μm composed of NASICON-type Li–Al–Ti–P–O (LATP) glass ceramics from OHARA Inc. was used because it has high lithium-ion conductivity (1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C), and no protonic conductivity. Also, it is impervious to water, stable in air and water, and electrochemically inert (Fig. 1 (a)). Dense sintered SEs were used to prevent the cathode and the anode electrolytes from mixing (Fig. 1 (b)). For linear sweep voltammetry, Ti, Pt, an SCE, glass fiber, and 12 mol L−1 LiCl were used as the working electrode (WE), counter electrode (CE), reference electrode (RE), porous separator, and aqueous electrolyte, respectively. The WE surface was thoroughly cleaned with pure ethanol under ultrasonic agitation, followed by washing with pure water two times and then drying before measurement. For cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, LMO was used as a cathode active material with extraction/insertion potentials below the potential of O2 evolution to ensure the stability of the aqueous electrolyte [22–24]. LTO was used as an anode active material with high lithium insertion/extraction potentials for decreasing H2 gas evolution. Pt and an SCE were used as the CE and RE, respectively. The aqueous electrolyte was 12 mol L−1 LiCl, which exhibits a higher apparent equilibrium potential (electrode potential resulting from simultaneous H2 evolution and lithium insertion/extraction at the LTO anode) than that of electrolytes with lower lithium concentrations. The SE and porous separators were located between the WE and CE. Fig. 3 shows CV measurements using the SE and porous separators. For the aqueous LTO/LMO test cell, a Pt electrode and SCE were used as the CE and RE, respectively. The apparent area of the WE was about 0.45 cm2. The apparent areas of the cathode and anode for galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were 0.785 cm2. The loading of the LMO cathode and the LTO anode material in the cell were 10.9 mg cm−2 and 2.48 mg cm−2, respectively. 2.2 Electrochemical measurements Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were carried out using a Hitachi Miniscope TM3000. Linear sweep voltammetry and CV were performed using an HSV-100 (HOKUTO DENKO) electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode electrochemical cell.

In this work, the application of microwave irradiation to suppress the limiting J-T distortion in pristine LMO (LMO-p) materials and improve the electrochemistry of lithium-ion batteries has been reported. Unlike thermal heating, microwave irradiation inhibits J-T distortion. To establish the underlying science behind the impact of microwave irradiation, both the pristine (LMO-p) and the microwave-treated counterpart (LMO-m) are subjected to several characterization techniques, including synchrotron XRD, XPS, powder neutron diffraction (PND), MAS 7Li NMR, Raman and BET analysis. These techniques prove that LMO-m possesses the needed physico-chemical properties that explain: i) suppressed J-T distortion (such as an increased average Mn oxidation state (i.e., n Mn ≥ 3.5+ or Mn4+/Mn3+ > 50%)), decreased lattice parameter, enhanced BET surface area, and enhanced structural crystallinity), and ii) improved electrochemical performance (such as increased specific discharge capacity, electronic and Li-ion transfer kinetics, and Coulombic efficiency). Microwave irradiation improves the specific capacity by about 21% and capacity retention (0.022% capacity loss per cycle for the LMO-m, ∼ 0.036% capacity loss per cycle for LMO-p for 100 cycles).

The two solutions were mixed and placed in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 30 min. 2.2 Synthesis of M-MOG membranes Five kinds of non-gelatinized solution were dissolved in ethanol until the concentration reached about 2 mmol ml−1, then 0.2 ml obtained solution was dropped to cast on copper foil. Finally, the as-prepared electrodes were dried in a vacuum at 70 °C for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. 2.3 Structural characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data was recorded on Deutschland BRUKERD2 PHASER X-Ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) with accelerating voltage and current of 50 kV and 100 mA, respectively. The thermal stability of MOG membranes was measured on a NETZSCH-STA-409 CD thermal analyzer by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under air with a heating rate of 4 K min −1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source) was applied to analyze the composition and elemental valence of samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured to determine the morphology and particle size of the MOGs by SEM analysis (Hitachi S-3400-N) and TEM analysis (HitachiH-800), respectively. The surface resistivity of MOG membranes was measured by an insulation resistance measuring instrument DSM-8104 and SME-8310 (Hitachi Electric Co., Ltd., Japan). Disk-shaped samples (approximately 30 mm in diameter and thickness of 2 mm) were prepared. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) transmission spectra were recorded using a Nicolet AVATAR 370 infrared spectrometer with the range of 400–4000 cm−1. The specific surface area of Ni-MOG was calculated by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation based on the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms which were recorded utilizing a Builder SSA-4200 instrument. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical tests were conducted with coin cells (CR2032). Five different loadings of MOG membranes and pure NPCFs were directly used as the working electrodes. The density of the active material was about 1.5–1.8 mg cm−2. A lithium foil was used as the counter electrode, and Celgard2400 was used as the separator. The mixed solution containing LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DMC/DEC, 1:1:1 vol %) was employed as electrolyte. The coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O, O2\\0.1 ppm, MBraun, Germany). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured in a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. CV was recorded at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 within the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V, and EIS was recorded at open potential over the frequency range from 100 to 0.01 Hz. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed on NEWARE CT-3008 instrument between 0.01 and 3.0 V vs Li/Li+ at room temperature. 2.5 Computational methods In theoretical study, periodic density functional theory (DFT) was used for calculation and the mixed B3LYP functional was used for empirical correction associated with SDD basis set [29]. All the calculations were performed with Gaussian 09 [30] software.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "A sensitive, reliable, and cost-effective detection for SARS-CoV-2 was urgently needed due to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Here, a “signal-on” magnetic-assisted PEC immunosensor was constructed for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein based on Z-scheme heterojunction. Fe3O4@SiO2@Au was used to connect the capture antibody to act as a capture probe (Fe3O4@SiO2@Au/Ab1). It can extract target analytes selectively in complex samples and multiple electrode rinsing and assembly steps were avoided effectively. CdTe QDs sensitized TiO2 coated on the surface of SiO2 spheres to form Z-scheme heterojunction (SiO2@TiO2@CdTe QDs), which broadened the optical absorption range and inhibited the quick recombination of photogenerated electron/hole of the composite. With fascinating photoelectric conversion performance, SiO2@TiO2@CdTe QDs were utilized as a signal label, thus further realizing signal amplification. The migration mechanism of photogenerated electrons was further deduced by active material quenching experiment and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement. The elaborated immunosensor can detect SARS-CoV-2 N protein in the linear range of 0.005–50 ng mL−1 with a low detection limit of 1.8 pg mL−1 (S/N = 3). The immunosensor displays extraordinary sensitivity, strong anti-interference, and high reproducibility in detecting SARS-CoV-2 N protein, which envisages its potential application in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "SiO2@TiO2@CdTe QDs", "application": "signal label in magnetic-assisted PEC immunosensor for SARS-CoV-2 N protein detection", "props": {"detection_limit": "1.8 pg mL-1 @ S/N = 3", "linear_range": "0.005–50 ng mL-1"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Fe3O4@SiO2@Au/Ab1", "application": "capture probe for SARS-CoV-2 N protein detection", "props": {}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Circular basswood-based membranes were collected by cutting the basswood chips to thickness of 1.0 mm and diameter of 25 mm. Dopamine, Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O), tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl), silver nitrate (AgNO3) and citric acid (CA) were obtained from Aladdin, Shanghai. Propranolol, atenolol, bisoprolol and celiprolol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Shanghai). 2.2 Characterizations Morphological structures of various synthesized materials were collected by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI5300) was applied to study the chemical constitution and bond cooperation of different surfaces. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra was obtained by an FT-IR Nicolet560 (Nicol, U.S.). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1200 series) had been used for detecting the solution concentration of propranolol, atenolol, bisoprolol and celiprolol. The detecting conditions were as follows: 290 nm for UV detection wavelength, methanol/0.02 mmol/L KH2PO4 (50/50, v/v) for mobile phase, 0.9 mL/min for flow rate and 25 °C for column temperature. 2.3 Synthesis of three-dimensional PDA-based Ag&TiO2-modified molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes (PAT-MIMs) on basswood-based surfaces/channels 2.3.1 Modified experiment of dopamine self-polymerization on basswood PDA-modified basswood (PDA@basswood) was prepared on basswood membrane by modification through the self-polymerization procedure of dopamine. Typically, a piece of basswood membrane was initially immersed in Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH = 8.5) aqueous solution (50 mL) for 15 min. Dopamine (0.1 g) would be then added into the above solution to start the self-polymerization procedure for 6.0 h under normal stirring conditions, the whole experimentation was carried out under the room temperature. PDA@basswood would be finally prepared after a rinsing process by using excess deionized water, which could remove the unreacted molecules and the redundant PDA. The as-obtained PDA@basswood were stored in an oven at 45 °C. 2.3.2 Modified experiment of TiO2 followed by Ag onto the PDA@basswood A hydrolysis process of ammonium fluotitanate was carried out on the surface of PDA@basswood, the TiO2-modified structure was then obtained. Thereinto, a piece of PDA@basswood membrane was immersed into a mixed solution containing (NH4)2TiF6 (100 mM) and H3BO3 (300 mM) at first. After 60 s, the pH value was then adjusted to 3.86 and the stipulated binding reaction was started for 1.0 h. TiO2-modified PDA@basswood membranes (TiO2-PDA@basswood) would be obtained after being washed with excess deionized water and stored in an oven at 45 °C. Next, a piece of TiO2-PDA@basswood would be added into a CA aqueous solution (0.25 M, 100 mL), let it sit for 60 min, then rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. The Ag-modified membrane (Ag&TiO2-PDA@basswood) was synthesized by adding the as-soused TiO2-PDA@basswood into AgNO3 aqueous solution (0.1 M) followed by adding 10 mL of CA aqueous solution (0.25 M), the modification process of Ag-based layer would be performed for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, Ag&TiO2-PDA@basswood could be obtained after being rinsed with excess deionized water and stored in an oven at 45 °C. 2.3.3 Synthesis of PAT-MIMs by developing a sol-gel imprinting strategy For the preparation of PAT-MIMs, the as-prepared Ag&TiO2-PDA@basswood were used as supporting membranes and a sol-gel imprinting strategy was developed and designed using propranolol as the template molecule, APTES as the polymeric functional monomer and TEOS as the cross-linking agent. Initially, 1 mmol of propranolol and 0.5 mL of APTES were dissolved in 45 mL of ethanol, this as-obtain mixture solution was then agitated for 15 min (300 rpm). Secondly, 1.5 mL of TEOS and two pieces of the as-prepared Ag&TiO2-PDA@basswood were then added, anther stirring process for 10 min was then carried out. Finally, 0.5 mL of NH3·H2O was put into the above-mentioned solution to initiated the sol-gel imprinting polymerization, the whole sol-gel process time was confirmed as 6.0 h. The as-synthesized membranes (PAT-MIMs) were rinsed with ethanol/acetic acid (95:5, v/v) for many times to remove the template molecule (propranolol in this work), and the as-prepared membranes were vacuum dried in an oven using 45 °C. In contrast to the PAT-MIMs, non-imprinted membranes (NIMs) were then prepared without adding propranolol molecule during the sol-gel imprinting polymerization to study and compare the selectivity of our synthesis strategy of PAT-MIMs. 2.4 Performance tests For the performance test of porosity, water flux, adsorption, selectivity and permselectivity, please refer to Supporting Information.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "PDA@basswood", "Syns_method": "dopamine self-polymerization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "dopamine", "amount": "0.1 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "Tris-HCl", "amount": "10 mM"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "Tris-HCl solution", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent": "Tris-HCl", "ph": "8.5"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "45 °C"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Ag&TiO2-PDA@basswood", "Syns_method": "TiO2 and Ag modification", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "(NH4)2TiF6", "amount": "100 mM"}, "prc2": {"name": "H3BO3", "amount": "300 mM"}, "prc3": {"name": "AgNO3", "amount": "0.1 M"}, "prc4": {"name": "CA", "amount": "0.25 M"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "100 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "CA solution", "amount": "100 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent": "H3BO3", "ph": "3.86"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "45 °C"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "PAT-MIMs", "Syns_method": "sol-gel imprinting strategy", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "propranolol", "amount": "1 mmol"}, "prc2": {"name": "APTES", "amount": "0.5 mL"}, "prc3": {"name": "TEOS", "amount": "1.5 mL"}, "prc4": {"name": "NH3·H2O", "amount": "0.5 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "45 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "rinse", "parameters": {"solvent": "ethanol/acetic acid (95:5)", "time": "multiple"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "45 °C"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "A major challenge in upscaling and commercializing dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) is to simultaneously rely on a robust photoconversion efficiency (PCE) along with long-term device stability. Two-dimensional (2D) nanocarbon materials are known to improve the PCE and stability of devices made of hybrid nanocomposite photoanodes. However, there is inadequate knowledge on how the morphology of 2D nanocarbon materials plays an important role in improving photovoltaic (PV) performance and stability. Here we report the comparative effect on the PV performance and the long-term stability of DSSCs made of optimal loadings of few-layer graphene (FLG) flakes and graphene nanoribbons (GNR) into the mesoporous TiO2 active layer.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Materials and Methods\nSynthesis of Titanium Oxide Support\nThe titanium oxide nanostructure support was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. TiO2 was initially dispersed by stirring in NaOH 10 M (TiO2 to NaOH molar ratio of 1:30) to form a suspension. The suspension was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave vessel and maintained at 145°C for 20 h. The resulting precipitate was immersed in 0.1 M HCl for 6 h, followed by washing with distilled water until the pH of the washed solution reached 7. The washed powder was subsequently dried at 100°C for 3 h and then annealed in 450°C for 2 h in air with a heating rate of 5°/min. The obtained powder was denoted as TNT.\nSynthesis of VPO/TiO2\nCommercial V2O5 underwent treatment with ultrasonic vibration in a NaF solution to enhance its active surface area for catalytic activity,48,49 serving as the vanadium source. The microwave-assisted synthesis of VPO proceeded as follows. A total of 2 g of the treated V2O5 was refluxed in a three-neck round-bottom flask containing 80 mL of a mixture of 2-butanol and benzyl alcohol (3:2 v/v), heated by microwave radiation at 300 W for 30 min. After that, a solution composed of 1.6 mL of 85% H3PO4 and 12 mL 2-butanol was added to the flask, and the mixture was refluxed under microwave radiation for another 30 min. The resulting dark green suspension was centrifuged, washed sequentially with distilled water and acetone, and dried at 110°C for 24 h. Finally, the obtained bronze was annealed at 460°C for 6 h to obtain VPO.\nFor preparation of the VPO/TiO2 composite (VPO/TNT), VPO (0.15 g), TiO2 (1.00 g), and 40 mL of distilled water were vigorously stirred on a hot plate at 60°C until the water evaporated. The solid obtained was then dried at 110°C for 24 h, followed by annealing at 400°C for 5 h in air.\nSynthesis of Ag/VPO/TiO2 Catalyst\nAg nanoparticles were prepared from the reduction of AgNO3 by ascorbic acid, following a procedure described previously.50 Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 1.00 g) and AgNO3 (0.30 g) were dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water through vigorous stirring in a three-neck round-bottom flask with a condenser at 60°C. Ascorbic acid (1.55 g, with an AgNO3/ascorbic acid molar ratio of 1:5) was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water and added dropwise to the flask to reduce Ag+ ions to Ag0. After 5 h of stirring, a yellow transparent solution containing Ag nanoparticles was obtained. Subsequently, 1.90 g of the VPO/TiO2 composite was introduced, nitrogen was purged into the flask, and stirring continued for 12 h. The resulting Ag/VPO/TNT catalyst was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum at 60°C for 12 h.\nMaterial Characterization\nThe structure was analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) on a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer, scanning at a rate of 2°/min. The surface morphology and chemical composition were examined using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) detector. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL 1400 microscope operated at 120 kV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were collected on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 instrument in reflection mode within the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with 32 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1.\nCatalytic Reaction\nThe liquid-phase oxidation of toluene and styrene was carried out in a round-bottom flask under nitrogen atmosphere and at a specific temperature. The quantities of catalyst and reactants and the reaction times are detailed in Table I. Firstly, the liquid substance and acetonitrile solvent were stirred in the flask containing Ag/composite for 30 min. Nitrogen was continuously blown through the flask to maintain an inert environment. The oxidation reaction was initiated by slowly adding H2O2 (35% solution) dropwise to the mixture while stirring. Upon completion of the reaction, the liquid phase was separated from the catalyst by centrifugation and subjected to gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890a, HP5 column 30 m × 0.25 mm) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). For comparison, the catalytic activity of VPO and VPO/TNT in the oxidation of toluene and styrene was also tested using the same procedure. The conversion of toluene and styrene and the selectivity towards benzaldehyde were calculated based on the GC result using cyclohexene as internal standard. Conversion was determined as [moles of substrate reacted] × 100/[moles of substrate used], while selectivity was calculated as [moles of benzaldehyde] × 100/[moles of substrate converted].\nTable I Chemical ingredients and catalytic conditions of the alcohol oxidation reaction\nFull size table\nThe alcohol oxidation was investigated using a three-electrode setup on a BioLogic MPG2 workstation (France). To prepare the working electrode, 2.5 mg of the powder (VPO, VPO/TNT, Ag/VPO/TNT), 1 mL of ethanol, and 10 μL of 5% Nafion/isopropanol solution (Fisher) were combined and sonicated for 10 min. Subsequently, 2.5 μL of the resulting homogeneous suspension was drop-cast onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 0.071 cm2) and dried at 60°C. The deposition process was repeated four more times to increase the mass loading on the GCE.

An Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatograph was used to determine organosulfur concentrations in the outlet with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Before and after each test, a nitrogen stream (500 mL min−1) was run through the system for 1 hour for rinsing. The sulfur adsorption capacities were calculated using the breakthrough time, considering the first detection of 1% of the inlet concentration.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Rapid in-situ synthesis of MOFs Rapid in-situ synthesis of MOFs refers to a synthesis process in which the precursor reaction solution of MOFs and sensing substrate are directly synthesized in a one-pot reaction solution in specific circumstances. For instance, HKUST-1 can be produced by a two-step synthesis on a glassy carbon electrode. After obtaining copper hydroxide, HKUST-1 is obtained in the presence of BTC [31]. In this process, MOF nucleates and growth occur spontaneously on the sensing substrate, forming a \"substrate type\" structure, which results in excellent compatibility and a tight interface bonding strength between the MOF and substrate. In addition, in-situ growth method can be used to prepare ZIFs with metal oxides or other materials as the core. This method allows for the activation of the core surface to become acidic, which can then react with alkaline zinc ion solution to displace the hydrogen ions and form a zinc-based platform that can be bridged to the organic ligands. The ZIFs can also adsorb other molecules after their formation, which further enhances the overall versatility [32]. Rapid in-situ synthesis of MOFs can be enabled by in-situ self-assembly, in-situ etching, and in-situ encapsulation as shown in Fig. 2 . The in-situ synthesis strategy necessitates specific interfacial interactions between the MOF precursor and the substrate. There are two main types of interactions that occur during this process. The first type involves the active participation of the substrate in MOFs synthesis, which can occur in two ways: (1) anchoring to metal cations on the substrate. The metal cation on the substrate surface can serve as an anchoring active site for the in-situ generation of MOFs. At the initial stage, the organic ligand acts as an initiator, triggering the reaction between the metal cation and the ligand, which promotes the epitaxial nucleation and growth of MOFs; and (2) ligand-assisted transformation. The substrate can not only provide an anchoring site but also a metal source eliminating the need for an additional metal source. The ligand-substrate interaction promotes the release of metal ions, which are subsequently coordinated with the ligand, resulting in the nucleation and growth of MOFs on the substrate surface. The second type involves the substrate acting solely as a carrier or another composite component, without participating in the synthesis of MOFs. In this case, the unmodified polymer substrate often exhibits limited active sites on the surface, resulting in poor interfacial bonding with the MOFs, and the formation of uneven and non-dense MOFs crystal films. In order to improve the bonding between the MOFs film and the substrate for promoting the nucleation and growth of the MOFs crystal films, it is crucial to increase the active sites on the substrate surface through modification. The binding mechanisms between different sensing substrates and MOFs precursors are different. For instance, polyester is a synthetic fiber that generates numerous carboxylic acid functional groups on its surface after acid hydrolysis. These functional groups can immobilize metal nodes, thus providing a metal source for the growth of MOFs crystal films and further enhancing the bonding of the substrate to the MOFs film. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a water-soluble, biodegradable polymer material with a large number of abundance hydrophilic hydroxyl groups, its exceptional chemical stability and mechanical properties, together with its low-cost film formation, make PVA a highly desirable substrate for MOF synthesis. Crucially, the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups in the structure of PVA can react with metal ions to effectively immobilize them on the MOFs, thus promoting further crystal growth. Polyimide (PI) resins, on the other hand, are aromatic heterocyclic polymer containing imide-based chain links, and the presence of plentiful polar imide groups on the PI surface facilitates the nucleation and growth of MOFs crystals. Graphene, due to the abundant hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on GO or rGO lamellae, offers a unique platform for in-situ MOFs synthesis. Graphene can not only act as a binding site for MOFs, but also actively participates in MOFs synthesis, effectively immobilizing the MOFs nanoparticles (NPs) in the GO and rGO lamellae. Meanwhile, the π-π stacking of graphene lamellae is favorable for the interactions between graphene and MOFs, further enhancing their bonding [33]. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) play dual roles as template and precursor in MOF synthesis, providing surface-ordered metal cations for anchoring the active site, a source of metal cations, and interlayer spaces, which creates an optimal environment for MOF nucleation and growth [34]. In brief, each of these substrate materials offers unique advantages for MOFs synthesis, from the hydrophilic nature of PVA and PI to the reactive functionalities of graphene and the templating capabilities of LDHs. By carefully selecting and modifying these substrates, the performance and stability of the resultant composite materials can be significantly improved. 2.1 In-situ self-assembly In-situ self-assembly refers to the process in which organic ligands are spontaneously arranged into ordered spatial structures on the substrate by direct or indirect specific interactions with MOF precursors immobilized on the substrate as basic structural units. Compared to conventional co-mingling methods, this process is very simple and fast as no special devices are required and intermediates do not need to be separated [35]. Additionally, the in-situ self-assembly approach can maintain a uniform dispersion of MOF particles, thus solving the agglomeration problem of MOF particles and avoiding the use of potentially environmentally hazardous organic solvents. Because coordination connections exist between metal ions and organic ligands, MOF synthesized through in-situ self-assembly is found to be more stable [36]. 2.2 In-situ etching In the in-situ etching process, the metal substrate acts as both a conductive substrate and the metal ion source, providing metal ions for the ligands in solution [28], and the MOF precursor reacts with the substrate through etching and grows directly onto the substrate. This method allows the substrate to have great surface morphology and flatness prior to growth [37]. In-situ etching allows the substrate and MOFs to grow together, thus enhancing the adhesion and stability of the MOFs to the substrate. In addition, most MOFs possess a crystalline structure, which significantly affects their loading in the polymer matrix, especially for some glassy polymers with rigid backbones, leading to unavoidable interfacial defects. Jiao et al. [38] utilized in-situ etching to construct ZIF-8/polymer hybrid membranes, in which the partial decomposition of the ZIF-8 NPs could be gradually etched along their surface to generate abundant coordination unsaturated metal sites, forming an almost defect-free interface. 2.3 In-situ encapsulation In-situ encapsulation refers to the process of encapsulating guest molecules with MOFs during the self-assembly of metal ions with organic ligands, which generally takes place through two competing growth mechanisms, \"biomimetic mineralization\" and \"co-precipitation\". \"Biomimetic mineralization\" means that the MOFs precursors nucleate on the surface of the biomolecule and further grow into biomolecule@MOFs crystals, facilitated by the surface of the biomolecule. The process of \"co-precipitation\" means that the biomolecule passively co-precipitates with the MOFs crystals [39]. The two modes of embedding can be switched between each other, thus enabling enhanced biosensing [40]. This \"one-pot\" encapsulation method is advantageous in that, firstly, it can effectively encapsulate biomolecules, regardless of their size, shape and pore size; secondly, the MOF layer protects the biomolecules from external stimuli, and the sensing signals are transmitted through an accessible porous network, thus enabling them to perform their biological functions despite extreme environments [41]; and additionally, in-situ encapsulation minimizes translocation effect during encapsulation that leads to loss of activity [42]. Compared to the other encapsulation methods, in-situ encapsulation has a higher loading capacity, providing more active sites and improving detection sensitivity. The rapid encapsulation of proteins within MOFs is related to the surface charge and chemical properties of proteins, and it is usually a protein with low surface electrostatic potential that concentrates metal cations and induces the encapsulation process [43]. Ouyang et al. [44] reported a novel amino acid enhanced one-pot encapsulation (AAOPE) strategy, where the presence of amino acids accelerates the formation of pre-nucleation clusters and the generation of MOFs around proteins, leading to rapid encapsulation/co-encapsulation of a variety of proteins including enzymes within MOFs with high efficiency, while avoiding the effect of surface charge on encapsulation. Using a defect formation strategy, Jiao et al. [45] constructed a macroporous MOF-Fe by metal-competitive coordination and oxidation to achieve the in-situ encapsulation of β-glucosidase and to enhance its catalytic activity and stability under mild conditions.", "output": {}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental\nReagents\nCerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, ≥ 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, C10H16N2O8, ≥ 99.1%, Sigma-Aldrich), polyethylene glycol 6000(C2nH4n+2On+1, ≥ 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 28–30%, Sigma-Aldrich, triarylmethane dye, crystal violet (CV, C25H30ClN3, ≥ 90%, Sigma-Aldrich) and ethyl alcohol (CH3CH2OH, ≥ 99.5%, Chem-Supply, Australia) were purchased and used without any further treatment.\nMethods\nSynthesis of Ce-PEG nanocomposite was carried out by hydrothermal processing. For synthesis, solution A was prepared by dissolving 1 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O in 10 ml of DI water by magnetic stirring for 30 min. Solution B was prepared separately by dissolving 2 mg of EDTA in 10 ml of DI water. After complete dissolution of EDTA, 15 ml of PEG (15% w/v solution) and 2 ml of NH4OH solutions were added into the beaker and sonicated for 10 min. After formation of clear solution, the two solutions were mixed and magnetically stirred at 60 °C for 20 min. The resultant solution was then sealed into a Teflon-lined autoclave (50 ml) and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h inside an oven. After processing, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature and precipitated particles (precursor) were collected by centrifuging at 6420×g for 10 min. The obtained precipitate was dried at 70 °C for 12 h inside an oven. After drying, the product was stored inside a cleaned glass vial. The obtained sample was also calcined under inert atmosphere (Ar gas) at 500 °C in a tube furnace to verify the oxidation state of cerium.\nThe process of hydrolysis and amination resulted in the formation of PEG bis(amine), which linked the cerium NPs (CeO2 and Ce2O3) to form Ce-PEG bis amine (abbreviated as Ce-PEG nanocomposite) composite, Figure S1. Schematic of the nanocomposite preparation is shown in Fig. 2.\nFigure 2\nSchematic for the preparation of Ce-PEG composite using hydrothermal processing\nFull size image\nCharacterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained using an Empyrean diffractometer, Malvern Panalytical with selected scanning angle 2θ = 10–80 degree (°) at 40 kV and 40 mA, scan rate 1.5 ° min−1, and step size 0.02° using a monochromatic CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Ȧ) as emission source. The morphology of the Ce-PEG nanocomposite structure was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM 7500F, JEOL Ltd). Platinum (Pt) coating was applied to the particles on carbon tape attached to an appropriate size aluminium (Al) base.\nThe crystal morphology and the lattice fringes of the samples were observed and analysed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, ARM200F, JEOL Ltd). For TEM specimens preparation, first, NPs suspensions were prepared by sonication, and then, 2–3 drops of suspension were poured on to carbon tape, and allowing it to dry.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to determine the oxidation sate of Ce and other species on the surface of the samples. The spectra were recorded using a NEXA XPS (Thermo scientific™) with Al Kα radiations (hυ = 1.487 keV) as X-ray excitation source under high vacuum < 10–8 mbar. Avantage data analysis (Thermo scientific™) software package was used to analyse the XPS data.\nUV–Vis absorption spectra were collected using a UV-1800 series spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) in the 200–800 nm wavelength range. Samples were suspended in CH3CH2OH by sonication (Branson 3800 brand, Ultrasonic Corp.) before UV absorption measurement. The optical band gap (Eg) of the samples was evaluated from the UV measurements using the Tauc relation [1, 44]:\n$$\\left( {\\alpha h\\nu } \\right)^{n} = A\\left( {h\\nu - E_{{\\text{g}}} } \\right)$$\n (1) \nwhere α is absorption coefficient, h the Planck’s constant, ν the photon’s frequency, A the proportionality constant and Eg the optical band gap. The value of the exponent (n) can vary between 0.5 and 3, depending upon the transition from the conduction to valence band in a semiconductor material.\nPhotocatalytic activity\nThe photocatalytic activity of the synthesized nanostructures was determined from the degradation of the crystal violet dye with reference to P25 photocatalyst. A photochemical reactor (model RPR-200, Rayonet) lined with phosphor-coated lamps (300 nm and 350 nm wavelength) and fitted with 50 W (W) lamps was used for the dye degradation experiments. The chamber temperature was maintained at 25 ± 2 °C during the experiment. A 100 ml suspension containing NPs (10 mg L−1) and dye (5 mg L−1) in a quartz beaker was stirred for 5 min inside the UV reactor and then irradiated for a period of 60 min with 10 ml aliquots were collected periodically every 10 min. The process was repeated for NPs (5 mg L−1), control and P25 (5 mg L−1) for reference photocatalytic activity measurement. The degradation of dye after irradiation was measured using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) in the 200–800 nm wavelength range. The changes in absorption were calculated from the average peak absorbance at λ = 590 nm of three samples at the respective time interval. The plots of relative absorption and degradation kinetics were used to evaluate the photocatalytic activity.\nCell cultures\nAdherent HaCaT (human keratinocyte) cell line (PMID: 2450098) was employed in this study for cytotoxicity evaluation. The identity of the HaCaT cells was verified by STRP (short tandem repeat profile at Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Australia). The cell cultures were grown and maintained in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One) supplemented with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle (DMEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) media, 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS, Bovogen Biologicals, Australia), which was heat-inactivated before use. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2 and passaged using 0.5% trypsin solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) when the cells approached confluency every 3–4 days. Negative mycoplasma test of cells was routinely checked using the MycoAlert™ detection kit (Lonza Biosciences).\nCell viability study\nCytotoxicity of Ce-PEG nanocomposite and Ce-NPs was evaluated using the MTS assay kit (Promega CellTiter 96™). In this assay, 100 μL of cells at a concentration of approximately 15 × 104 cells per well were seeded in a flat-bottomed 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2 for 24 h to enable cell adhesion. Firstly, NPs were sterilized by exposing them to UVC light for 20 min, then suspended in a cell culture media at concentrations of 50 mg L−1 and 5 mg L−1 by sonication for 1 h. Then, the prepared NPs suspensions were added to respective cells containing wells at concentrations of 0, 5 and 50 mg L−1 and further incubated at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2 for 24 h. After 20 h incubation time with NPs, MTS reagent (20 μL) was added to each well of the respective plates and then incubated for 4 h to enable the colour development. Then, the plates were centrifuged at 750×g for 10 min and a volume of 75 μL of the supernatant was transferred to the corresponding wells of a new flat-bottomed 96-well plate and the plate was read at λ = 490 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax Plus 384 type, Molecular Devices, USA). Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated in three separate experiments (n = 3). The assays performed using the cells only were used as a negative control, whereas assays in the presence of ZnO NPs (< 100 nm, Sigma-Aldrich) and P25 were referred as positive controls. The viability (% of control) was obtained from the plots of the absorption data for each tested concentration.\nThe photo-induced toxicity on exposure to UVA/UVB radiation in the presence of Ce-PEG nanocomposite, Ce NPs with reference to TiO2 (P25) and control (cell only) was also evaluated. The cells were grown in a 96-well plate at a concentration 15–18 × 104 cells per well in a similar fashion as described in the procedure for cell viability assay without UV radiation exposure. The tested samples suspensions (50 mg L−1) were prepared in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, without Ca+2, Mg+2) supplemented with 2% FBS by sonication for 1 h. After 24 h incubation period, the media from the wells was removed and replaced with NPs suspensions to make a total volume of 100 µl per well. The cells were incubated further for 1 h to allow the interaction of NPs/nanocomposite with cells. After 1 h, the cells were exposed to light source for a period of 15 min at an intensity of 6 mW cm−2 using a 300 W sunlamp (Ultra-Vitalux, OSRAM). During the exposure, the cell containing plates were placed on ice to avoid the heat-induced damage. After UVA/UVB exposure, the media from the cells was removed and a fresh media of 100 µL was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 24 h. After this period, cell viability was assessed in the same fashion as performed in the assay without UV irradiation.\nStatistical analysis (One-way ANOVA with Tuckey’s post-hoc test) was performed on each assay using the software Prism 7.02 (GraphPad software Inc., USA). For analysis, a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. The viability data of synthesized cerium nanostructures were compared with ZnO NPs and P25 because of their similar applications as UV filters.\nIntercellular ROS measurement\nThe adhered HaCaT cell culture after 24 h of passage were treated with CeO2 NPs and Ce-PEG nanocomposite at a concentration of 50 mg L−1 in a flat-bottom 96-well plate and incubated further for 24 h. After 48 h mark, the cells were washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated with fresh culture medium containing 0.5 mM H2O2 or/and 0.5 mM N-acetylcysteine amide (NAC) for 1 h. Then, cells were washed with DPBS and incubated with 20 µl of 0.5 mM 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) dye for 30 min in the dark. Finally, the cells were washed thrice with DPBS to remove the extracellular dichlorofluorescein (DCF) dye, and a volume of 100 µL of DPBS was added to each well and the dye fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA FL BMG LABTECH) at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) wavelength of 490/520 nm. Blank reading was subtracted from the respective cell containing wells readings of each individual assay. Each assay was repeated in three separate experiments in triplicate manner, and mean values were plotted as the change in DCF intensity (% of control).", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Ce-PEG nanocomposite", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal processing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ce(NO3)3·6H2O", "amount": "1 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "EDTA", "amount": "2 mg"}, "prc3": {"name": "PEG 6000", "amount": "15 mL"}, "prc4": {"name": "NH4OH", "amount": "2 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "20 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "20 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "180 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "centrifuge", "parameters": {"time": "10 min"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C"}}}}}}}

After detecting the electrochemical characteristics, the surface properties of HOC-NT were investigated.

The results showed that a unique micronano composite structure on the HOC-Ti surface with excellent hydrophilicity and suitable surface roughness was created after anodic oxidation promoted by its electrochemical characteristics. The YAP protein may play an important role in regulating bone remodeling by β-catenin and Rankl/OPG Signaling Pathways. An in vivo study also revealed an accelerated formation rate of new bone and more stable osseointegration around the HOC-NT implant.

It is important to maintain an easy and environmentally-friendly fabrication process. This research led to the successful creation of a sophisticated type of titanium oxide, featuring a TiO2/anatase phase interface and a significant unique outer layer. A unique exterior level was created using an eco-friendly method and modification of deep tunable solvents. This resulted in a 3D structure made of 2D ultrathin nanosheets with mesopores. We synthesized Dy2Sn2O7 nanoparticles and combined them with aromatic ring-doped C3N4 nanosheets (Ar-C3N4; Ar = Ph, Pm, Py,) which were deposited onto nanofibrous titanium (Dy2Sn2O7@Ar-C3N4/NFT) as a nanoceramic. The employment of NFT was discovered to supply numerous hydroxyl groups, enabling consistent loading of Ar-C3N4 via molecular binding engagement. By exploring the potential of fibrous structure in nanoceramic production, a novel and innovative approach is being pursued, which has the potential to revolutionize the field of catalysis in the petroleum industry. Moreover, Ar-C3N4 could adjust fibre sizes and offer active amino group adsorption sites, aiding in chemisorption with organic compounds. The surface features and porous architecture of the Dy2Sn2O7@Ar-C3N4/NFT composite were preserved after Dy2Sn2O7@Ar-C3N4 loading, suggesting the maintained crystalline form. This remarkable catalyst, displays an impressive capability in facilitating the desulfurization process, all while adhering to environmentally friendly conditions. Moreover, in order to further enhance its sustainability credentials, this catalyst has been crafted with the support of oxygen green oxidant, ensuring a greener approach to the desulfurization process.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Material and methods 2.1 Synthesis of grafted UIO-66 composites and its characterization The synthesis of MOF was derived from commercially available chemicals and did not require further purification. Experiments were carried out based on previously published research (Mo et al., 2023). The whole preparation procedure of UIO-66-BTC is displayed in Scheme 1 , its precursors were prepared by using UIO-66, which was prepared by our group in the preliminary stage, as the substrate. Briefly, 0.840 g ZrCl4 and 0.648 g Terephthalic acid (H2BDC) was dissolved in 30 mL and 10 mL of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), respectively. Add 13.6 mL of conditioner (CH3COOH, with the purpose to adjust the size of MOF crystals and defects in the crystals), stir well, and transfer to a 100 mL reaction vessel and react at 393 K for 24 h. After the reaction, the products were separated by centrifugation and alternately soaked in DMF and methanol, respectively, and repeated three times for 12 h each. The resulting product was dried at 333 K overnight to obtain the precursor (UIO-66). Then, 0.200 g UIO-66 and 1.200 g of BTC was added into 50 mL of deionized water and refluxed in a water bath at 333 K with stirring for 24 h. After the reaction, At the end of the reaction, the solid-liquid separation was performed and washed with deionized (DI) water and methanol for three successive repetitions. Then, the resulting product was dried in an oven at 333 K overnight. Finally, the white powder obtained was UIO-66-BTC. Material characterization techniques are detailed in the supplementary information. 2.2 Adsorption/desorption experiment Experiments were performed to examine the influence of UIO-66-BTC on the adsorption performance of MB by controlling different variables [solution pH, adsorbent dosage, adsorption temperature, etc.]. In the desorption experiments, the adsorbent was shaken continuously for 6 h with the addition in 50 mL of 1 M ethanol to keep the MB completely resolved, after which the adsorbent was washed sufficiently with DI water to investigate the reusability of UIO-66-BTC. The adsorption was conducted by shaking in a constant-temperature air bath. After the adsorption equilibrium, the corresponding centrifuge tube was removed and approximately 10 mL of supernatant was withdrawn using a 10 mL syringe without a needle, a 0.45 μm size filter tip was fitted to the syringe, the solution in the syringe was filtered through the tip and the filtrate was collected into a 10 mL centrifuge tube. The absorbance was determined via UV spectrophotometry to give the remaining content of MB in solution and the adsorbent adsorption and removal of MB were calculated to determine the optimum experimental conditions. Eqs. (1) and (2) were applied to calculate the adsorption (q, mg∙g−1) and removal (η, %) of MB in solution at equilibrium. (1) q = ( C 0 − C t ) V M Where C 0 and C t are MB content in solution at the initial time and content at moment t, mg∙L−1; V is solution volume, L; M is adsorbent dosage, g.

The theoretical constraints of the LM[nonlinear Eq. (S1) with linear Eq. (S2)] are limited to a monolayer on the surface and there is no buildup of adsorbed molecules, whereas the FM [nonlinear Eq. (S3) with linear Eq. (S4)] can be applied to explain adsorption based on non-homogeneous surface energy. In this study, two models and their nonlinear forms were used and contrasted to obtain the best match for the experimental results. 2.3.2 Kinetic models To explore the adsorption mechanism and its potential rate-limiting step, three adsorption kinetic models, namely the pseudo-first-order (PFO) [Eq. (S5)], pseudo-second-order (PSO) [Eq. (S6)] and intraparticle diffusion [Eq. (S7)] kinetic models were used to fit the process of MB adsorption by UIO-66-BTC. 2.3.3 Thermodynamic studies Further to gain insight into the nature of the adsorption procedure, a thermodynamic study of MB adsorption on UIO-66-BTC was carried out to understand the energy changes at varying temperatures of 298, 308, and 318 K. The thermodynamic parameters determined were the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG θ), the enthalpy change (ΔH θ), and the entropy change (ΔS θ).

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Abstract\nThis study aimed to investigate the effect of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nano additives on the thermal performance of a pilot-scale cross-flow cooling tower. Moreover, it is a continuation of our previous study on the effect of using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanofluid, and the results were compared with the results of TiO2 and previous work. An experimental design by response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) with two factors (concentration and flow rate) was used to study the effectiveness of the setup, Merkel number, and the cooling range. The nanofluids were prepared by the two-step method. The stability tests were performed considering different surfactants such as Gum Arabic, Triton X-100, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, and Gum Arabic was determined as the optimal surfactant. The visual method, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Zeta potential analyses were used to ensure the stability of the nanofluids and determine the size distribution of the nanoparticles in the nanofluids. The findings revealed that the heat transfer characteristics of the working fluid were improved with the addition of nanoparticles. Moreover, by comparing the effect of nanoparticles, it was found that MWCNTs could enhance the thermal features better than TiO2.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "High-capacity metal sulfides have been extensively investigated as cathode materials for secondary batteries. Despite their high capacity, the redox potential of metal sulfides is limited to 2.7 V. Therefore, researchers explored its application as a negative electrode material and discovered its exceptional electrochemical performance. However, the conventional methods for synthesizing transition metal sulfides (TMS) inevitably require an external source of sulfur for secondary sulfidation, resulting in energy dissipation. In this study, L-cystine was adopted as a polydentate ligand for the synthesis of MxSy@N, SC metal-organic frameworks, which can confine the desired carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur sources within the framework. This approach facilitates one-step sintering to obtain nitrogen-doped transition metal sulfides. The structure composition and electrochemical reaction mechanism of FeS@N,S-C as the negative electrode in Na-ion batteries were studied through scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)/X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The electrochemical properties of FeS@N,S-C materials were test as an example. The FeS@N, SC composite exhibited a reversible Na+ storage capacity of 724.4 mAh g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1, and still maintained a reversible capacity of 600.7 mAh g−1 at a current density of 2000 mA g−1, demonstrating excellent rate performance. After 200 cycles, the material was still able to retain 97.3 % of the discharge specific capacity, demonstrating fine cycle performance. It shows that the FeS@N, SC composite has rapid electron conduction ability and high sodium ion diffusion coefficient.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and experiments 2.1 Materials n-Octadecane (99.0 %, 0.78 g/cm3) with a melting temperature of 28.5 °C was adopted as phase change materials. Formaldehyde solution (37 wt%) and melamine (99.0 %, 1.57 g/cm3) were used as the reacting monomers to form MF shell. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 97.5–99.0 mol%) was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, ≥98.5 %) at 1:1 mass ratio to prepare compound emulsifiers. Tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA, technical grade, 0.99 g/cm3) was used as curing agent for epoxy resin. The aforementioned materials were supplied by Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Hydrophilic lipophilic nano-TiO2 (99.8 %, 4.26 g/cm3) with an average particle size of 5–10 nm was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. γ-(2, 3-epoxypropoxy) propytrimethoxysilane (≥98.0 %, 1.07 g/mL at 25 °C), a silane coupling agent obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., was used for surface modification. Epoxy E51 (technical grade, 1.22 g/cm3), acted as the polymer matrix of the composite, was provided by Kunshan Jiulimei Electronic Materials Co., Ltd. Unless specified otherwise, all the reagents and raw materials were used as received. 2.2 Synthesis of microcapsules The formation mechanism and flow diagram of preparing microcapsules by in situ polymerization are presented in Fig. 1 . A process involved mixing 2.92 g melamine, 5.62 g formaldehyde solution, and 50 mL deionized water with pH 9.0 at 70 °C to prepare MF prepolymer. The Oil in Water (O/W) emulsion was obtained by mixing 7 g compound surfactant solution (3 wt%) and 5.0 g n-octadecane with a homogenizer dispersion machine at a speed of 8000 rpm for 20 min. The MF prepolymer suspension was then added dropwise into the beaker with emulsion under a reaction temperature of 65 °C and mild agitation at 400 rpm. The pH of the reaction system was adjusted to 4.5 to initiate the polymerization. Finally, the prepared microcapsules were obtained by filtration, washing, and drying after the reaction lasted for 3 h. The process of preparing MF-TiO2 hybrid shell microcapsule is quite similar to that of synthesizing n-octadecan@MF microcapsules. The only difference between these two procedures is whether nano-TiO2 is dispersed into the prepolymer solution. 2.3 Surface modification of microcapsules EPTMS was employed to modify MF shell and MF-TiO2 hybrid shell microcapsules to improve the interfacial adhesion with the epoxy matrix. Through surface modification, epoxy groups were grafted onto the microcapsules, resulting in increased interfacial interactions between the microcapsules and epoxy resin [11]. Specifically, EPTMS was hydrolyzed to produce a 1 wt% solution in advance. Next, 5 g of microcapsules were added into 100 g of the aforementioned solution and the mixture was stirred at 400 rpm for 3 h at 85 °C. The surface-modified microcapsules were collected after filtration, washing, and drying. 2.4 Preparation of microcapsule/epoxy composites Microcapsules were firstly added into Epoxy E51 resin and dispersed at 1300 rpm for 5 min using a vacuum deaeration mixer. Then, the mixture was blended with curing agent (TEPA) at a fixed ratio (Epoxy E51: TEPA = 1: 0.14 by weight) and degassed under vacuum at 1300 rpm for 3 min to remove tiny bubbles. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was poured into dog-bone-shaped silicone molds and cured at room temperature for 5 days. To investigate the effect of microcapsule content on the mechanical properties of the composites, different weight percentages, i.e. 2.5 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, and 20 wt%, of microcapsules were added into epoxy resin. Composites were named MPCMs/E51, E-MPCMs/E51, and ET-MPCMs/E51, according to the types of microcapsules in epoxy E51 matrix. 2.5 Characterization The microscopic morphology of microcapsules and the fracture surface of tensile samples were examined by a Zeiss SIGMA HV-01-043 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of microcapsules were obtained by using a Nicolet 6700 + Continuum FTIR spectrometer. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Nano Xflash Detector 5010, Bruker, Germany) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific, USA) were applied to analyze the surface chemical compositions and element contents of microcapsules. The diameter of single microcapsule was measured with Olympus OLS4500 laser scanning confocal microscope. The diameter distribution of microcapsule was evaluated by a HORIBA LA-950 laser granularity analyzer. The energy storage capacity was tested by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, TA DSC25, USA) in the temperature range of 0–60 °C under a nitrogen flow rate of 40 mL/min. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) were performed on a thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA TGA55, USA) at 10 °C/min from 20 °C to 600 °C. The rupture strength of single microcapsules was determined by an Agilent Nano Indenter G200 system equipped with a flat-ended indenter. Synthesized microcapsules were scattered on the sample holders and the microcapsules with a diameter around 20 μm were picked out using the confocal laser scanning microscope subsequently. Next, each microcapsule was compressed to rupture at a loading rate of 0.5 mN/s. To ensure reliability and repeatability, at least five samples for each type of microcapsule were tested. Uniaxial tensile tests were carried out on the dog-bone-shaped specimens at a constant rate of 1 mm/min by using a universal material testing machine (Instron E10000, USA).", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "n-octadecan@MF", "Syns_method": "in situ polymerization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Melamine", "amount": "2.92 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "Formaldehyde solution", "amount": "5.62 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "n-octadecane", "amount": "5.0 g"}, "prc4": {"name": "compound surfactant solution", "amount": "7 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "emulsify", "parameters": {"speed": "8000 rpm", "time": "20 min"}, "substances": [{"name": "compound surfactant solution", "amount": "7 g"}, {"name": "n-octadecane", "amount": "5.0 g"}]}, "post_proc2": {"step": "polymerize", "parameters": {"temperature": "65 °C", "time": "3 h", "pH": "4.5"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "filter", "substance": [{"name": "microcapsules"}]}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry"}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "EPTMS-modified microcapsules", "Syns_method": "surface modification", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "microcapsules", "amount": "5 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "EPTMS", "amount": "1 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrolyze", "parameters": {"temperature": "85 °C", "time": "3 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "filter", "substance": [{"name": "surface-modified microcapsules"}]}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry"}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "MPCMs/E51", "Syns_method": "dispersion and curing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Epoxy E51", "amount": "1 part"}, "prc2": {"name": "TEPA", "amount": "0.14 part"}, "prc3": {"name": "microcapsules", "amount": "2.5-20 wt%"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dispense", "parameters": {"speed": "1300 rpm", "time": "5 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "cure", "parameters": {"temperature": "room temperature", "time": "5 days"}}}}}}}

KB and S8 were mixed using an agitating mortar, then transferred to a vial and maintained at 155 °C for 12 h to allow for the diffusion of sulfur into the pores of KB. A typical slurry was made by mixing the S/KB composite, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, CMC2200, Daicel FineChem), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR, JSR Corporation) in distilled water at a weight ratio of 96.5 : 1.5 : 2. For comparison, 3 wt% TiB (Mitsubishi Material) was added to the slurry at a weight ratio of S/KB : TiB : CMC : SBR = 93.5 : 3 : 1.5 : 2. The obtained two kinds of slurry were both coated onto carbon-coated aluminium foils as current collectors and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the cathodes sulfur content for TiB and TiB free electrode is 70.1% and 72.3%, respectively. Then, the cathodes were cut into a disk shape (for coin cells) or rectangular shape (for pouch cells) and dried in an oven under vacuum at 40 °C for 12 h before use. The electrodes with and without TiB were denoted as the TiB electrode and TiB free electrode, respectively.\nThe SL-based highly concentrated electrolyte was prepared according to the method reported in our previous paper.35 First, a highly concentrated [Li(SL)2][TFSA] electrolyte was prepared by mixing SL (battery grade, Kishida Chemical) and Li[TFSA] (Solvay Japan, water content <50 ppm) at a molar ratio of 2 : 1 to form a homogeneous solution. Then, HFE (Daikin Industries) was added to the above concentrated electrolyte to obtain a homogenous mixture of [Li(SL)2][TFSA]-4HFE. The traditional electrolyte used in this study was composed of 1 M Li[TFSA] in DOL/DME (1/1 vol/vol) with 0.5 wt% LiNO3 as an additive. All the mixing processes were carried out at room temperature in an Ar-filled glove box (VAC, dew point <−80 °C, [O2] <1 ppm).\nA 2032 coin cell was assembled in an Ar-filled glove box using the sulfur cathode (14 mm in diameter), an Li metal anode (Honjo Metal, 16 mm in diameter), the electrolyte (80 μL), and a Celgard 3501 separator. For the pouch cells, a layer-by-layer process was applied to laminate the cathodes (coating of either one or both sides of carbon coated Al current collector, 45 × 35 mm), separator, and anodes (50 × 40 mm). As the anode, Li metal coated on both sides of Cu foil (Li thickness = 90 μm, Honjo Metal) was used. The charge/discharge measurements (HJ1001SD8, Hokuto Denko) were performed at 30 °C with cut-off potentials of 1.0 and 3.3 V for the discharge and charge steps, respectively. The same type of coin cell made with the traditional DOL/DME electrolyte was subjected to charge/discharge measurements in the potential range 1.7–2.8 V. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was used to demonstrate the polysulfide conversion in the electrode on the versatile multichannel potentiostat 3/Z (VMP3). A 0.02C constant current discharge was applied for 1 h and after that, the cell was left at open circuit potential for 2 h and the voltage equilibration is recorded.\nTo study the electrochemical products on the sulfur cathodes during cycling, the cells were disassembled in an Ar-filled glove box. The sulfur cathodes were separated and rinsed several times with pure HFE to remove the electrolyte residue. The pieces of the cathodes were all kept under an inert atmosphere during sample preparation and transfer to the testing instruments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed on a JEOL JSM-6390 to observe the morphologies of the electrodes and obtain elemental mappings. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 Advanced Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Physical Electronics Quantera scanning X-ray microprobe. The XPS data were fitted using the Casa XPS software assuming a Gaussian/Lorentzian line shape after Shirley background correction. The contact angles of SL on the sulfur cathodes were measured using a Rame-Hart Model 190 contact angle goniometer at room temperature.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental\nAluminum nitrate [Al(NO3)3.9H2O], zinc acetate [Zn(CH3CO2)2], titania nanoparticles (TiO2), copper (ll)acetate [Cu(CH3COO)2], ammonium nitrate (NH4) (NO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), acetic acid (CH3COOH), SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), polyvinylpyrrolidone [(C6H9NO)n], water-based polymeric resin, ethanol (C2H5OH), deionized water, and sugar (as a stabilizer) were purchased from the Merck Co., Ltd.\nAfter preparing the raw materials, the nanoparticles used in this research were synthesized and the coating was applied to the specimens.\nSynthesis of nanoparticles\nIn this study, ZnO, Al2O3, and CuO nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized. Due to the shortage of raw material for the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter range of 20–30 nm were purchased from the Merck Company.\nSynthesis of ZnO nanoparticles\nThe sedimentation method was used to synthesize the zinc oxide nanoparticles. First, an appropriate amount of zinc acetate (4 g) was dissolved in 50 ml of ethanol. Next, the test vessel was placed on a magnetic stirrer and stirred at room temperature for half an hour. Once all the zinc acetate composition was dissolved in a solvent and there was no trace of the white zinc acetate in the solution, the temperature of the stirrer was increased by 150 °C to remove the unwanted materials. The reaction was carried out to the point where the white sediment was formed in the test vessel and all the solvent vaporized in the test vessel. Afterward, the precipitate was kept at room temperature for 2 days to dry. Finally, calcination was performed to complete the nanoparticle synthesis process from a thermodynamic point of view. For this purpose, the powder was placed in the electric furnace for 14 h at 300 °C.\nSynthesis of alumina nanoparticles\nThe hydrothermal method was used to synthesize the nano-gamma alumina. In the hydrothermal process, some parameters such as type of water, time, temperature, and pH play a critical role in the process. Besides, water atmosphere and pressure along with temperature generate the driving force of the hydrothermal process and therefore compensate the thermal energy required to complete this process. Hence, this process takes place at a lower temperature (Sokolov et al. 2019). For this purpose, 3 g of aluminum nitrate and 0.5 g of sugar (as a stabilizer) were dissolved in 50 ml of the DI water and placed on a magnetic heater-stirrer at 35 °C for 1 h. Since pH plays a decisive role in the formation of alumina with different morphologies, ammonium nitrate was used in this research to control the pH of the solution. Sugar is rich in the natural regenerators of glucose, fructose, and galactose. Using this regenerative agent, which simultaneously performs resuscitation and acts as a high-temperature surfactant, the aluminum ions were reduced to the aluminum atoms and oxidized at high temperatures. During the formation of nanoparticles, this agent protected the particles from agglomeration. As a result, different morphologies of the nanoparticles based on PH were obtained.\nThe solution is then transferred to an autoclave with a volume of 75 ml and placed in an electrical furnace at 300 °C for 20 h. After that, the samples were washed with the alcohol, centrifuged, and dried at 100 °C. Finally, the samples were calcinated and converted into the gamma phase for 5 h in a furnace at 900 °C.\nSynthesis of the CuO nanoparticles\nThe chemical degradation method was used to synthesize the copper oxide with the nanometer size. For this purpose, 200 ml of the 0.20 molar copper acetate solution was dissolved in the deionized water and then 1 ml of the acetic acid was added to this solution. The solution was poured and heated in the reflux container. When the temperature reached 90–95 °C, 1 g of NaOH was added to the solution. By adding the NaOH, the solution immediately turned dark and the copper oxide nanoparticles formed. The refluxing process lasts for 10 min to synthesize the copper oxide nanoparticles uniformly. The NaOH and acetic acid control the structural growth and destruction process to synthesize the copper oxide nanoparticles with uniform dimensions. The final product was decanted, washed with the DI and ethanol–water after the centrifugal precipitation, and finally dried at 60 °C.\nPreparation of the anti-corrosion nanoparticles\nAfter preparing the anti-corrosion composite coating, the synthesized nanoparticles were converted to a nano-fluid and then stabilized in the resin-based water.\nStabilization of the nanoparticles in the transparent polymer resins and coating implementation\nAfter preparing various nanoparticles, to produce a stable nano-fluid, each of the nanoparticles of alumina, zinc oxide, copper oxide, and titan, with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was converted to a stable nano-fluid. For this purpose, 0.1 g PVP was dissolved in 50 cc DI water, to which 1 g of each of ZnO, Al2O3, CuO, and TiO2 nanoparticles were added. Table 1 represents the optimal conditions for producing the stable nanofluids from various nanoparticles.\nTable 1 The optimal conditions for the production of stable nanofluids from various nanoparticles\nFull size table\nIn the next step, the SDS surfactants were used to stabilize nanoparticles in the transparent polymer resins. Surfactant-modified nanoparticles were added to the polymer resin and mixed for 5 h. After about 5 h of vigorous stirring under the dry conditions at 30 °C, solvent and reactive chemicals were removed from the environment and the anti-corrosion coating was made ready for aging. Finally, the nanocomposite coating implementation on the copper substrates was performed via the tape casting method.\nCharacterization\nPhase behavior and microstructure of the coatings were investigated using X-ray diffraction [XRD, Philips, Cu Kα (ʎ = 1.54 Å)], high-resolution (field emission) scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS; EG&G Instruments Inc, model 273) were performed to assess the corrosion behavior of the ceramic nanocomposite coatings on the copper substrate in a 3.5% NaCl solution at the ambient temperature. The frequency range was from 10–2 Hz to 105 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. A conventional three-electrode cell with the saturated calomel, samples, and a platinum electrode was used as the reference, a working, and auxiliary electrodes, respectively.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Nowadays, fires caused by thermal runaway (TR) of lithium ion battery (LIB) remains a potential risk in its application. An effective method is urgently required to suppress LIB fires. In this work, a novel cooling method combining dodecafluoro-2-methylpentan-3-one (C6F12O) agent with intermittent spray cooling (ISC) is proposed for suppression of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery fires. Besides, the influence of spray frequency and duty cycle (DC) on spray cooling efficiency are discussed. The results indicate that atomized C6F12O can effectively suppress LFP fires, reduce the production of toxic gases and heat release rate (HRR). However, after C6F12O runs out, the rapidly elevated temperature and the release of combustible gases mean that the TR battery requires longer and more efficient cooling. Compared with continuous spray cooling (CSC), ISC not only extends low temperature duration but also decreases the temperature rise rate of the battery. As DC increasing, C6F12O agent first exhibits an enhancement effect and then an inhibition effect on cooling performance. It is suggested that the optimum DC is 55.4% for the suppression of 14 Ah LFP fires.

CAS Key Laboratory of Design and Assembly of Functional Nanostructures Fujian Key Laboratory of Nanomaterials Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter Chinese Academy of Sciences Fuzhou 350002 PR China Unlike common solvent extraction and chemical precipitation, a novel extraction-precipitation process for the separation of Li and transition metals using p-tertylphenoxyacetic acid (POAA) is developed. Extraction-precipitation method refers to a method in which the extraction-precipitant can quantitatively extract the metal ions to form solid extracted complex without the requirement of organic solvent or carrier, and the extraction-precipitant can be stripped and recycled. In this study, the extraction-precipitation mechanism and thermodynamic parameters between POAA and manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) were analyzed. Subsequently, the equilibrium time and pH value of the separation process were optimized. Finally, the leach solution of LIB having Li, Ni, Co, Mn with concentration of 3.52 g/L, 7.93 g/L, 5.72 g/L, and 14.16 g/L, respectively, was studied for the separation at pH 4.5. The results indicate that efficient separation of Li and transition metals was possible by one-step precipitation using 0.2 mol/L POAA solution (degree of saponification = 100%) when the ratio of nPOAA/nMn+Co+Ni was 2. The separation factor for the transition metals over lithium (β CoNiMn/β Li) reached as high as 133,014. After the transition metal-loaded POAA was stripped with 2 mol/L sulfuric acid, the stripped solution could be used for the production of ternary material precursor, and the regenerated POAA could be recycled for the extraction-precipitation process. The lithium in the solution was recovered in the form of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) with a purity level of 97.7%. This high efficiency and sustainable process based on extraction-precipitation has shown potential application for spent LIB recovery. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Spent lithium-ion battery Extraction-precipitation Recovery Co-precipitation 1 Introduction Lithium-ion battery (LIB) is known to be one of the most clean and promising sustainable energy storage material, with wide applications in the field of new energy vehicles (EVs) and portable electronic devices (Khalifa et al., 2019). China began to promote new EVs vigorously in 2013 with the new EVs entering a stage of explosive growth post 2014. Complete electrification of traditional internal combustion EVs by China is anticipated by 2050. As the lifespan of LIBs in New EVs is 6–8 years, the scrapped LIBs from the used EVs of China is expected to reach peak by 2020 (Technology, 2019). The major components of commercial LIBs are 25%–30% cathode material, 14%–19% graphite, 10%–15% electrolyte, 5%–9% copper foil, and 5%–7% aluminum foil (Duan et al., 2020). Due to the presence of toxic and harmful substances in both the electrolyte and cathode materials, the spent LIBs are sources of useful metals. They are also sources of environmental pollution, and thus their recycling have attracted widespread interest (Huang et al., 2018). Various methods of metal recovery from spent LIBs at present include pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy and direct regeneration technology (Dhiman and Gupta, 2019; Fan et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2021). Among them, hydrometallurgy is the most extensively followed method due to its continuous operation mode, low energy consumption and high recovery efficiency (Othman et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2018). Before the hydrometallurgical step for recycling, a series of pretreatment steps (such as unloading, dismantling, crushing and screening) are required for safe and effective separation of different components of LIBs (Kim et al., 2021). Subsequently, acid leaching in the presence of reductant is carried out for the metal from the active cathode material (Golmohammadzadeh et al., 2018). Then the leach solution is subjected to various separation steps including selective chemical precipitation, solvent extraction, electrochemical process or a combination of these methods to recover valuable metals from the leach solution (Huang et al., 2016). Chemical precipitation process is widely used for the recovery of various metals from the leaching liquor of LIBs as it is simple and easily adoptable industrially. In the leach solution containing Li, Ni, Co and Mn, addition of a stronger oxidant can lead to the recovery of Mn in the form of MnO2 as a precipitate (Sattar et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). In addition, adding dimethylglyoxime can selectively precipitate Ni (Castillo et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2015). Oxalic acid or oxalate can be used to selectively precipitate Co from Li-containing solutions (Nayaka et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2012). Lithium in the leachate is often recovered by precipitation with sodium carbonate (Gao et al., 2017; Meshram et al., 2015). The characteristics of high separation factor and ease of continuous operation result in wide application of solvent extraction method in hydrometallurgical industry and has also found extensive applications for the recovery of various metals from the leach solution of LIBs (Tanong et al., 2017). The synergistic extraction system composed of Ionquest 801 and Acorga M5640 has been used to remove impurities from Fe, Cu and Al in the leach solution of LIBs (Pranolo et al., 2010). The synergistic extraction system, composed of Versatic 10 and LIX 84-I, has been found to yield a synergistic effect on the extraction of Ni, and Ni can be selectively extracted from the leach solution of LIBs containing Li, Mn, and Co (Joo et al., 2016b). The anti-synergistic effect on Co for the mixture of Versatic 10 and D2EHPA can be used for the selective extraction and separation of Mn from the LIBs leachate containing Li, Ni, and Co (Joo et al., 2016a). Cyanex 272 has been used for the separation of Co and Ni (Li) from the LIBs leach solution due to its high selectivity for Co and Ni (Li) (Pranolo et al., 2010). Various ionic liquids like Aliquat 336, Cyphos 101, Cyphos 102 and [P8888][Oleate] have been reported to be selective for Co and Mn from the hydrochloric acid leachate of LIBs (Cheng et al., 2019; Dhiman and Gupta, 2019; Othman et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). The component metal Mn, Co, Ni and Li from the leachate can be separated and recovered one by one employing the above mentioned multiple separation schemes (Chen et al., 2015; Choubey et al., 2021; Dhiman and Gupta, 2019; Yang et al., 2020). However, the similar physical and chemical properties of Mn, Co and Ni make the traditional recycling processes lengthy and also result in large losses of metal ions (Gratz et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2021). As the shortage of lithium resource affects the development of lithium battery industry, more and more attention is being paid towards the efficient recovery of Li as well as the regeneration technology of high value-added products from spent LIBs (Gratz et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2021). Recently, Yang et al. (2017) proposed a co-extraction method for the separation of transition metals from Li and the co-extracted Ni, Co, and Mn can then be directly used for the production of ternary material precursors. In spite of the completely different physical and chemical properties of Li compared to the transition metals (Liu et al., 2020), the existing processes of co-extraction of transition metals are still associated with some problems (Table 1 ). For example, the co-extraction of transition metals from LIBs leach solution using D2EHPA results in a loss of 30% Li at a Ni extraction efficiency of 85% (Yang et al., 2017). Despite the strong ability to extract Mn and Co by P227, the separation factor of Ni and Li is found to be less than 100 (Liu et al., 2020). When using Versatic 10 for the extraction of transition metals, the loss of Li is reduced to 8% with a high purity level of 99.6% for the recovered Li2CO3 (Lei et al., 2020). However, there is an entrainment of the raffinate and stripping solution in the organic phase and it is also necessary to add oil removal as an additional step prior to the subsequent wastewater treatment (Geng et al., 2020). Extraction-precipitation method which is essentially an organic solvent-free extraction process is a new separation strategy proposed by our lab. When the extraction-precipitant is added to the aqueous phase, a complex precipitate is formed by the extractant and metal ions. Thereafter the metal loaded complex precipitate can be stripped to obtain a concentrated metal ion solution, simultaneously regenerating the extraction-precipitant. In our previous work, the extraction-precipitation method has been used successfully for various applications, i.e., the enrichment of rare earth from the leachate of ion-type rare earth ore, the transformation of rare earth sulfate, and the treatment of Ca and Mg containing wastewater (Su et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018). In this article, carboxylic acid extraction-precipitant p-tert-butylphenoxy acetic acid (POAA, structure shown in Fig. 1 ) is studied for the separation of transition metals from Li in the leach solution of spent lithium batteries. First, the precipitation mechanism of POAA with Mn, Co and Ni was analyzed and the thermodynamic parameters of precipitation for each metal ion were calculated. Then the possibility of using POAA for the separation of transition metals and Li was studied. Finally, POAA was used to co-precipitate the transition metals from the actual leach solution. Based on the excellent results obtained from the experiments, a new recovery process based on extraction-precipitation method was proposed for the separation of Li and transition metals from the leachate of spent LIBs. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and solutions The synthesis and purification of POAA was carried out as per the report by Wang et al. (2018) (purity >98%). Prior to the use, POAA was saponified with 1 mol/L NaOH. For extraction-precipitation reaction, required concentration of POAA was prepared by diluting the saponified POAA with deionized water. Spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode materials were provided by Xiamen Jilin Trading Co. Ltd. Standard NaOH (1 mol/L) was purchased from Tansoole Company. Table S1 lists the other reagents used in this study. All the reagents were used as received without further purification. Stock solutions of CoSO4 (0.1 mol/L), NiSO4 (0.1 mol/L) MnSO4 (0.1 mol/L) and LiCl (1 mol/L) were prepared by dissolving the corresponding metal salts in deionized water. The stock solutions were diluted and prepared as a simulated feed solution for the extraction-precipitation study. The pH value of the simulated feed solution was adjusted with 1 mol/L NaOH or 2 mol/L H2SO4. 2.2 Characterizations The pH value was determined by the pHSJ-4F digital pH meter from Shanghai INESA Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., while the metal ion concentrations in the aqueous phase were determined using a Horiba Jobin Yvon ULTIMA 2 inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, French). The concentration of dissociated POAA in the aqueous phase was determined by an Agilent Cary 5000 UV–Visible Spectrophotometer (UV–vis, USA). The UV standard curve of dissociated POAA is shown in Fig. S1. The FT-IR spectra of different metal complex precipitate were recorded by a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 spectrometer in the range of 4000–500 cm−1. Phase analysis of the precipitates was performed by a MiniFlex 600 X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Ka) instrument. 2.3 Extraction-precipitation study The solutions of CoSO4, NiSO4, MnSO4 and LiCl with 0.01 mol/L concentration under neutral pH value were used to investigate the extraction-precipitation mechanism as well as analyze the thermodynamic parameters. After adding 5 mL of individual metal salt solution and 0.06 mol/L POAA solution (100% saponified) to the centrifuge tube, the mixture was equilibrated in a gas bath shaking device for 30 min to obtain the precipitate. Subsequently the solid and liquid were separated, and then the concentration of metal ion as well as dissociated POAA in the filtrate was analyzed by ICP-OES and UV–Vis, respectively. Next, a mixed solution containing Co, Ni and Mn ions each with 0.01 mol/L concentration in the presence of varying concentrations of Li ion (from 0.01–0.5 mol/L) was prepared. Effect of various parameters like equilibrium time, initial pH value of aqueous phase and Li ion concentration on the co-precipitation of Co, Ni and Mn with POAA were studied. All the experiments were carried out at 25 ± 1 °C. The saponified 0.06 mol/L POAA solution (5 mL) was mixed with 5 mL of simulated solution in a centrifuge tube, followed by equilibration in a gas bath shaking device for 30 min. The metal ion concentrations in the filtrate after solid-liquid separation were analyzed by ICP-OES. The precipitate containing transition metal-loaded POAA was dried overnight at 70 °C and then shaken with 5 mL H2SO4 for 30 min to achieve the stripping of the metal ions. After solid-liquid separation using a medium-speed filter paper, the metal ion concentrations in the stripped solution were analyzed by ICP-OES. The precipitation efficiency (P%), distribution ratio (D), separation factor (β) and stripping efficiency (S%) were calculated using the following equations: (1) P % = C ini V ini − C eq V eq C ini V ini × 100 % (2) D = C ini V ini − C eq V eq C eq V eq (3) β M 1 / M 2 = D 1 D 2 (4) S % = C st V st C ini V ini − C eq V eq × 100 % Here, C ini and C eq represent the aqueous phase concentration of metal ion before and after extraction-precipitation, respectively; V ini and V eq represent the respective volumes of the aqueous phase before and after extraction-precipitation; C st and V st represent the concentration of metal ions and volume of stripped solution, respectively; D 1 and D 2 represent the distribution ratios of metal 1 and metal 2, respectively. 2.4 Leaching study The spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode material was dissolved in aqua regia, followed by the analysis of chemical composition with ICP-OES (Table S2). The leaching experiment was carried out in a 250 mL round-bottom flask coupled with a condenser. Under the initial condition of 50 g/L pulp density and 300 rpm stirring speed, various parameters like H2SO4 concentration (0.5–2.5 mol/L), temperature (30–70 °C), time of leaching (10–180 min) and hydrogen peroxide dosage (H2O2, 0.0–2.0% (v/v)) was studied to optimize the leaching process. The leaching efficiencies of valuable metals under different leaching conditions are shown in Fig. S2. The optimum leaching condition was found to be pulp density of 50 g/L, H2SO4 concentration of 1 mol/L, stirring speed of 300 rpm, leaching temperature of 50 °C, leaching time of 60 min, and H2O2 dosage of 1% (v/v). The leach solution obtained from the optimum leaching condition was adjusted to pH 4.5 by adding NaOH solution and the ion concentrations of Co, Ni, Mn and Li in the leachate were measured as 5.72 g/L, 14.16 g/L, 7.93 g/L, and 3.52 g/L, respectively. 2.5 Extraction-precipitation study on LIBs leaching liquor The saponified POAA solution having varying concentrations (from 0.2–0.5 mol/L) was used to co-precipitate the transition metals in the actual leach solution of LIBs at 25 ± 1 °C. A sample of 50 mL of the leach solution was added into a 500 mL beaker, and then POAA solution was added into the beaker maintaining a molar ratio of 2:1 for POAA and the transition metal ions. After stirring the mixture at 300 rpm for 30 min, the solid-liquid separation was carried out by a vacuum suction filter device, and then ICP-OES was used to measure the concentration of metal ions in the filtrate. The precipitate containing the transition metals and POAA was washed with a small amount of water and dried overnight at 70 °C. In a 50 mL round bottom flask fitted with a condenser, the precipitate was added along with 12.5 mL of 2 mol/L H2SO4 followed by stirring at 95 °C for 30 min to strip the metal ions. After the POAA was solidified, medium-speed filter paper was used to filter the regenerated POAA. The concentration of metal ions in the stripping solution was analyzed by ICP-OES. The precipitation efficiency (P%) and stripping efficiency (S%) are calculated according to as per Eq. (1) and Eq. (4), respectively.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "CoNiMn-POAA Precipitate", "Syns_method": "extraction-precipitation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "POAA", "amount": "0.06 mol/L"}, "prc2": {"name": "CoSO4", "amount": "0.01 mol/L"}, "prc3": {"name": "NiSO4", "amount": "0.01 mol/L"}, "prc4": {"name": "MnSO4", "amount": "0.01 mol/L"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "5 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "strip", "parameters": {"temperature": "95 °C", "time": "30 min"}, "substances": [{"name": "H2SO4", "amount": "2 mol/L"}]}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent": "NaOH", "ph": "4.5"}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Li2CO3", "Syns_method": "precipitation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "LiCl", "amount": "3.52 g/L"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "filtered solution"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "precipitate", "substances": [{"name": "Na2CO3", "amount": "stoichiometric"}], "parameters": {"purity": "97.7%"}}}}}}}

The raw electroplating sludge was dried at 90 °C for 12 h in a blast dryer, and then ground through a 100-mesh sieve. Then, 20 g electroplating sludge dry powder was mixed with 100 mL hydrochloric acid (2 mol/L) and stirred for 4 h. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 3 min to obtain electroplating sludge leachate. (2) Synthesis of Fe3+/C. pyrenoidosa Precursors. C. pyrenoidosa were obtained by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 min from the chlorella solution. Then the C. pyrenoidosa were washed three times with distilled water. Subsequently, the washed C. pyrenoidosa were added into the prepared electroplating sludge leachate and stirring for 8 h. Finally, the Fe3+/C. pyrenoidosa precursors were separated and collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 min and washed three times with distilled water. (3) Synthesis of Fe3C@NPC and NPC. The obtained Fe3+/C. pyrenoidosa precursor were freeze-dried for 48 h. Then, freeze-dried Fe3+/C. pyrenoidosa and KHCO3 were mixed at a ratio of 1:2, fully ground and activated at 800 °C for 4 h under Ar atmosphere to synthesize spherical Fe3C@NPC. Similarly, pristine C. pyrenoidosa derived hierarchical porous NPC has also been synthesized. (4) Synthesis of S/Fe3C@NPC and S/NPC. The melt-diffusion method was used to load sulfur in the material. Fe3C@NPC and sulfur were mixed in a ratio of 3:7 and manually ground in an agate mortar for 30 min. Next, the mixture was heated at 155 °C for 12 h in an argon atmosphere to achieve sulfur encapsulation, and then heated at 200 °C for 2 h to remove the sulfur that was not firmly bonded to the material. At this point, the S/Fe3C@NPC composite was obtained. Similarly, the S/NPC composite has been prepared. 2.2 . Material characterization The morphology of the samples was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8010). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was conducted to characterize the functional groups on the surface of the sample by FTIR-5300. The elements and composition of the samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8, CuKα radiation, 0.154 nm), transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F) and its matching EDX. XPS ((ESCALAB 250 Xi) was used to determine the chemical state of each element in the samples. The degree of graphitization of the sample was tested by Raman spectral profiles (Thermo Fisher, DXR Microscope). The S content in the sample was accurately measured by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA Instruments Q50-TGA). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments were carried out to characterize the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples (Beckman Coulter SA-3100). 2.3 . Electrochemical test Firstly, 140 mg of S/Fe3C@NPC or S/NPC, 40 mg of acetylene black, and 20 mg of polytetrafluoroethylene were mixed to prepare a uniform cathode slurry. Then, the uniform cathode slurry was evenly coated on the Al foil collectors and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, CR2025 was assembled in an argon filled glove box by using the obtained S/Fe3C@NPC or S/NPC coated Al foil as the cathode, lithium metal foil anode and Celgard 2325 separator. The electrolyte of choice was 1.0 M LiTFSI with LiNO3 (2 wt.%) dissolved in a mixed solvent system consisting of 1,2-dimethoxyethane and dioxane (DOXL) (1:1 v/v). The cycle voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) tests of the coin-type cells were performed at CHI660E electrochemical on workstations. The rate capability and cycle performance were tested in on the LAND CT2001 system, while the voltage window was 1.7–2.7 V at various current rates. 2.4 . Computational details All calculations were performed on the basis of density Functional theory (DFT) [58], as applied in VASP [59,60]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [61] exchange correlation potential was used in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [62]. The core electrons were described by a projected enhanced wave (PAW) [63] pseudopotential wave. The valence/outer core electrons for each atom in self-consistent field calculations were listed in parentheses: C (2s2 2p2), N (2s2 2p3), P (3s2 3p3), Fe (3d64s2), S (3s2 3p4), and Li (2s1). For all optimization calculations, the cutoff energy of the plane wave was set to 420 eV, and the Monkhorst-Pack method was used for Brillouin region sampling, in which K point was set to 3*3*1. The convergence criteria for energy and force were set as 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Fe3C@NPC", "Syns_method": "heat", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe3+/C. pyrenoidosa precursors", "amount": "1 part"}, "prc2": {"name": "KHCO3", "amount": "2 parts"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "800 °C", "time": "4 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "NPC", "Syns_method": "heat", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "C. pyrenoidosa", "amount": "1 part"}, "prc2": {"name": "KHCO3", "amount": "2 parts"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "800 °C", "time": "4 h"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "S/Fe3C@NPC", "Syns_method": "melt-diffusion", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe3C@NPC", "amount": "3 parts"}, "prc2": {"name": "S", "amount": "7 parts"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "155 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "200 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "S/NPC", "Syns_method": "melt-diffusion", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "NPC", "amount": "3 parts"}, "prc2": {"name": "S", "amount": "7 parts"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "155 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "200 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}}}

Some samples were also measured by KBr technique using a similar setting of the measurement conditions and with a mass ratio of 1/100 (sample/KBr). The OMNICTM program was used to evaluate the FT-IR results. 3.2 NMR spectroscopy 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded at 300 K in CDCl3 or DMSO‑d 6 on a Varian Mercury Plus 400 FT NMR spectrometer operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.61 MHz for 13C. Each measuring cuvette contained 5 mg of sample dissolved in 0.6 mL of the appropriate denatured solvent. NMR data were recorded with chemical shifts (δ) reported in parts per million (ppm) and coupling constants (J) in Hertz. Chemical shifts were referenced to residual solvent signal: 1H NMR (7.26 ppm for CDCl3 and 2.50 ppm for DMSO‑d 6) and 13C NMR (77.16 ppm for CDCl3 and 39.5 ppm for DMSO‑d 6). 2D methods (gCOSY, gHSQC and gHMBC) were measured using standard Varian software and all NMR spectra were analysed using MNova 7.1.1 (2012) software. The spectrum signals are summarized in Section 2.2 and the spectra are shown as Figs. S3, S4, S6, S7, S9 and S10 in the Supplementary information. 3.3 Thermal analysis The thermal behaviour of the samples was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with simultaneous differential thermal analysis (DTA) using a Netzsch STA 409 PC/PG instrument. The sample was slightly grinded, placed in an Al2O3 crucible and heated in a temperature range of 25–900 °C under dynamic air atmosphere (flow rate 20 cm3∙min−1), with a heating rate of 9 °C∙min−1. Experimental data were processed by the NETZSCH Proteus software. 3.4 X-ray diffraction experiments Single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out on a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer equipped with a Bruker APEX II detector. For the compound UPJS-18(Dy) and UPJS-19(Eu), Mo/Kα wave radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) was used at a temperature of −153(2) °C (UPJS-18(Dy)) or −123(2) °C (UPJS-19(Eu)) and multi-scan absorption corrections were performed using diffractometer software. The structure model was solved by direct methods and refined with full-matrix least squares procedure on F 2 using the SHELXL-2018 software [55]. All atoms, except hydrogen atoms, were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters, and all hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and refined as riding modes with Uiso(H) assigned to 1.2Ueq of the adjacent aromatic carbon atom and the CH bond fixed to 0.95 Å. The structure model of compound UPJS-18(Dy) was disordered into two positions in the three parts of the structure due to relatively free rotation of its aromatic rings, with a highest occupancy factors of respective parts 0.57(3), 0.739(3) and the last one belonging to DMF molecule coordinated to Dy ion with a value of occupancy factor 0.5. The structure model of compound UPJS-19(Eu) was disordered into two positions in the three parts of the structure due to relatively free rotation of its aromatic rings, with the highest occupancy factors of respective parts 0.51(2), 0.65(1) and the last one belonging DMF molecule coordinated to Dy ion with a value of of occupancy factor 0.55. The structure UPJS-19(Eu) is additionally disordered in one aromatic ring into three positions with an occupancy factors of 0.5, 0.3 and 0.2. The SHELXL software suggests further disorder splitting for both compounds UPJS-18(Dy) and UPJS-19(Eu), but the further splitting does not lead to a higher accuracy. Structure images were visualized using DIAMOND software [56]. Crystallographic data of UPJS-18(Dy) and UPJS-19(Eu) are listed in Table S1 in the Supplementary information, and the selected bond lengths and angles are summarised also in the Supplementary Information in Table S2 for UPJS-18(Dy) and Table S3 for UPJS-19(Eu). The crystal structure of UPJS-18(Dy) and UPJS-19(Eu) has been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) under the registration numbers 2286816 and 2286817 and can be retrieved free of charge from https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures [57,58]. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were measured in reflection mode with Bragg-Brentano parafocusing geometry using aRigaku Ultima IV multipurpose diffractometer. X-ray lamp with Cu/Kαradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) was used. Powder samples were put on a glass sample holder and measured at 20 °C. Diffracted photons were collected using aD/teXUltrahigh-speed, position-sensitive detector system by scanning 2θ range from 10° up to 30° with the step size of 0.02°. To ensure reliable diffracted intensities each sample was spinning at 30 rpm during collecting XRD data. 3.5 UV–VIS spectrophotometry UV–VIS absorption spectra were measured in the solid phase on a Specord 250 spectrophotometer from Analytic Jena in the 200–500 nm wavelength range at room temperature. The samples were prepared by the same procedure as KBr pellet in Section 3.1, but subsequently they were cut to a size suitable for insertion into the measuring quartz cuvette. A pure KBr pellet was used for the background measurement to avoid the influence of absorption bands from the pellet material in the sample spectra. 3.6 Photoluminescence spectroscopy The room temperature emission photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired at the right angle on a photon-counting spectrofluorometer PC1 (ISS, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 280–380 nm (resolution step 1 nm). A 300 W xenon lamp was used as the excitation source. Excitation and emission slit widths were set at 1.0 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively. For the measurements, 1 cm path length rectangular quartz cuvette was used. For each complex, PL intensity was measured from powdered samples (2 mg) ultrasonically dispersed in absolute ethanol (5 mL) and the most transparent results were graphically processed and described. 3.7 Gas adsorption measurements Prior the gas adsorption experiments the samples (UPJS-18(Dy), UPJS-18(Ho) and UPJS-19(Eu)) were activated by a solvent exchange. In a typical activation procedure, the 60 mg of each sample was placed in an individual glass vial (2 mL), filled with 96% ethanol (1 mL), mixed with a rotary laboratory mixer (15 rpm) for 24 h and then decanted by injection. This procedure was repeated 3 times and then the decanted samples were filled with 99.8% anhydrous ethanol (1 mL) and left for slow diffusion for 7 days. After this time, the samples were decanted and vials with samples were placed in a vacuum oven and heated to 200 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C∙min−1 and kept at this temperature for 24 h. After this time, the vials were cooled down to ambient temperature and hermetically sealed. During the sorption experiments the samples were further fully outgassed in ultra-hight vacuum (UHV 1∙10-7 Pa) during heating to 200 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C∙min−1 for 20 h with two isothermal steps at 60 °C and 105 °C for 30 min each. Nitrogen and hydrogen adsorption and desorption were measured at −196 °C, while carbon dioxide was measured at 0 °C and a static manometric adsorption system (Autosorb iQ-XR, Quantachrome Instruments) was used for all gases at a relative pressure range at 1∙10−6–0.995 Pa. The void volume of a sample cell containing a sample was determined by a helium-free NOVA® approach. The results of adsorption isotherms were used to determine the specific surface area (SBET). 3.8 Contact angle measurements All contact angle measurements were performed using a 7 μL drop of purified water with resistivity of 18.2 MΩcm carefully placed on the surface. 60 mg of complex UPJS-18(Dy) was gently pressed onto a tablet and then activated by vacuum oven heated to 200 °C at the heating rate of 3 °C∙min−1 for 2 h with the isothermal step at 60 °C for 14 h. Image was performed by USB camera with an EO-3112C colour (Edmund Optics, USA) and contact angle was determined by NIH software with plug-in LB-ADSA.", "output": {}}

Membrane separation technology has become a research focus in wastewater treatment due to its advantages in environment protection, low sedimentation cost, low energy consumption and reusability. NPA/ZnMgAl-LDHs (NPA, nylon film material loaded with nano-TiO2 particles, LDHs, layered double hydroxides) material based on nylon film material (PA) was synthesized using a two-step method.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental\n2.1 Adsorbent Preparation\n2.1.1 Synthesis of Graphene Oxide (GO)\nGO was synthesized by oxidation of high-purity graphite powder according to the modified Hummer’s method (Hummers and Offeman, 1958). Two grams of natural graphite (Merck) and 1 g of NaNO3 were added to 45 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid (98%) under stirring in a flask immersed in an ice water bath and cooled to 0 °C. While maintaining vigorous mixing, 6.0 g of KMnO4 was gradually added to the suspension. The addition rate was controlled carefully to prevent the temperature of the rest from exceeding 20 °C. The ice bath was then removed, and the suspension temperature was brought to 30 °C, where it was maintained for 2 h under vigorous stirring. A total of 92 ml of deionized (DI) water was added, and the mixture was further stirred for 30 min at 95 °C. Finally, 185 ml of DI water was added to the mixture, followed by drop-by-drop addition of 6 ml of H2O2 (5%) to reduce the residual KMnO4 and terminate the reaction with the color of the solution turning from dark brown to yellow. The resulting solid graphite oxide was separated and washed with a 1:10 (v/v) solution of chloritic acid (37%) and DI water to remove metal ions. The resulting mixture was filtered and washed several times with DI water until the pH of the filtrate was neutral. The cake was dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h (Tourani et al., 2015b).\n2.1.2 Purification of CNT and Oxidation of CNT\nThe multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) used in this study (96% purity, 10–30 nm in OD) were prepared in-house at the Research Institute of the Petroleum Industry (RIPI), Iran, by a particular CVD method over a catalyst consisting of cobalt-molybdenum nanoparticles supported on nanoporous magnesium oxide (Co-Mo/MgO) at a temperature of 1000 °C. The methane decomposition reaction was conducted at atmospheric pressure with a retention time of 20–50 min. The purification procedure was as follows: A pristine MWCNT sample was added to a 1:1 (v/v) solution of HCl (37%) and DI water and mixed for about 16 h at 60 °C. The resulting mixture was filtered and washed several times with DI water until the pH of the filtrate was neutral. For further purification, the prepared materials were dissolved in a 1:3 (v/v) solution of nitric acid (65%) and DI water for 3 h at 60 °C with the resulting mixture filtered and washed several times with DI water until the pH of the filtrate was neutral. The resulting cake was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h, and to eliminate the amorphous carbons, the oven temperature was increased to 250 °C and held for 30 min. The purity of the MWCNTs was about 96%, and their diameters and lengths were between 10 and 30 nm and 5 and 15 μm, respectively. Oxidation of CNTs is commonly made by treating CNTs in strong oxidants such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). A sonochemical treatment procedure oxidized the MWCNTs in a 1:3 (v/v) solution of HNO3 (65%) and H2SO4 (98%) in an ultrasonic bath maintained at 60 °C for 3 h. The solution was then diluted in an ice bath for 8 h, filtered, and washed under a vacuum using DI water to remove excess acid and solvent until the pH of the filtrate was neutral. The cake was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h (Tourani et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2016).\n2.1.3 Synthesis of rGO-CNTs Composite\nAmong different methods commonly used for preparing rGO/CNT composites, we designed the rGO/CNT-105 and rGO/CNT-107 composites by adding oxidized CNTs to a homogeneous GO aqueous dispersion in the 10:5 and 10:7 weight ratios, respectively, under sonication for approximately 30 min. Oxidized CNTs are attracted to the surfaces of GO due to a strong π–π interaction. The mixture was then transferred into a 500-ml autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 12 h. The mixture was then cooled at room temperature with natural convection. A black gel-like 3D cylinder was obtained, and the solid products were separated by centrifuge and washed with distilled water. The composites were obtained by freeze-drying.\n2.1.4 Synthesis of MIL-101(Cr), MIL-101(Cr)/Sulfasalazine (Cr-TA/SSZ), and Cr-TA@SSZ/Composting Materials\nMIL-101(Cr) and MIL-101(Cr)/sulfasalazine (Cr-TA/SSZ) were synthesized according to the method described in our previous works (Tourani & Behvandi, 2022; Tourania et al., 2019), where 2 g of chromium nitrate (5 mmol), 0.83 g of TPA (5 mmol), 0.25 ml HF, and 25 ml ultrapure water were mixed well for 30 min followed by ultrasonication for 15 min. The mixture was then transferred into a 50-ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed, heated to 220 °C for 8 h, and cooled to room temperature. The green suspension of MIL-101(Cr) was then filtered using a Buchner funnel with a glass filter to remove the re-crystallized needle-shaped colorless TPA which remained on the filter and the MIL-101(Cr) suspension which passed through it. The rest was again filtered by soft filter paper (2–3 μm) to recover the green-colored products. To remove the unreacted TPA, the as-synthesized MIL-101(Cr) was washed (twice) with 30 ml DMF at 70 °C for 8 h with continuous stirring. After filtration, the synthesized MIL-101(Cr) was washed (twice) with 30 ml dried ethanol for 8 h to remove the DMF and additional water and was subsequently filtered again. The purified MIL-101(Cr) was dried overnight at 150 °C and stored in a desiccator after cooling to room temperature.\nFor the synthesis of Cr-TA@SSZ, the same method as the synthesis of MIL-101(Cr) was used, except that the sulfasalazine was added to the mixture with a molar ratio of 0.38 to chromium nitrate. Also, the amount of ultrapure water and terephthalic acid added to the mixture was about 1.5 times that of the previous method.\nFor the synthesis of Cr-TA@SSZ composite with GO, CNT, GO/CNT-105, and GO/CNT-107, we used the similar Cr-TA@SSZ fabrication instructions mentioned above, except that in each synthesis step, before mixing, an amount of 60 mg (equivalent to 10% by weight of the obtained pure MOF) of GO, CNT, GO/CNT-105, or GO/CNT-107 was mixed in 10 ml of DMF for 10 min. After 5 min of ultrasonication, the obtained mixture was added to the initial mixture to synthesize Cr-TA@SSZ. And after stirring for 16 h, we put the final mixture in the reactor at a temperature of 220 °C for 10 h. The washing and purification steps are the same as those for synthesizing MIL-101(Cr).\nThe schematics of the synthesis of MIL-101(Cr), MIL-101(Cr)/sulfasalazine (Cr-TA/SSZ), and Cr-TA@SSZ/composting materials are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nFig. 1\nThe schematic of the synthesis of MIL-101(Cr), MIL-101(Cr)/sulfasalazine (Cr-TA/SSZ), and Cr-TA@SSZ/composting materials\nFull size image\n2.2 Adsorbent Characterization Techniques\nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained in an XPert Pro diffractometer (Panalytical Corp., Netherlands) using Cu Kα radiation and a wavelength of 1.79 Å to determine the crystalline phases of the MOFs. The morphology of the prepared samples was obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images that were taken at 80 kV by a JEM 1230 phase consisting of 21% (by volume) acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 78.9% HPLC-grade water (JEOLCorp., Japan), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were performed from a ZEISS DSM960A electron microscope. The thermal stability of MOFs was checked by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) with Mettler Toledo (Australia). The samples were heated under N2 from room temperature to 800 °C at 10 °C/min. Textural properties of the adsorbents were specified using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 nitrogen sorption instrument. Before the measurements, the powder was degassed and activated under reduced pressure at 105 °C for 3 h. The BET equation was used to characterize the surface area and total pore volume.\nBefore and after the adsorption experiment, the TPA, p-tol, and BA concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a water model 600E instrument (USA) equipped with a 150-mm-long C18 column and a UV detector with wavelength set at 230 nm.\n2.3 Evaluation of Adsorbent Performance\nAdsorption experiments determined the performance of adsorbents. Before comparing the adsorption performance of adsorbing organic compounds (TPA, p-tol, and BA) by adsorbents from actual wastewater (WW), their performance was investigated in the artificial laboratory effluent. For this purpose, a precise amount of adsorbents (0.7 mg) was placed in an aqueous solution (20 ml) with the desired concentration (at a concentration of 2000 mg/l). The adsorbent solutions were mixed well using a magnetic stirrer for a specified period (24 h) at a constant temperature (25 °C). At the end of the test time, the solution was filtered with a soft paper filter, and the filtrate was analyzed to determine the residual pollutant concentration. Then the solution was measured before and after the experiment by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The amount of TPA, p-tol, or BA adsorbed on the adsorbents was calculated with the following mass balance:\n$${q}_{e}=\\frac{{(C}_{0}-{C}_{e})}{m}\\times v$$\n (1) \nwhere \\({q}_{e}\\) (mg/g) represents the equilibrium adsorption capacity, C0 (mg/L), and Ce (mg/L) are the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of adsorbate, and ν (L) and m (g) are the volumes of the solution and the mass of the adsorbent, respectively. In addition, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal from the wastewater (WW) was determined by the following equations:\n$${\\text{COD}}=\\left(\\frac{{{\\text{COD}}}_{0}-{{\\text{COD}}}_{e}}{{{\\text{COD}}}_{0}}\\right)\\times 100 (\\mathrm{\\%})$$\n (2) \nCOD0 and CODe (mg/l) are WW’s initial and

The commercial macroporous copper (Cu) foam current collector may only tackle these challenges to a little extent, and it is usually unable to provide sufficient Li nucleation sites, leading to rapidly increased polarization and unstable cycling performance. Herein, we report a three-dimensional composite anode comprising Li–Cu alloy melt-cast on a commercial Cu foam (CF) current collector (Li–Cu/CF), which can be converted to a unique architecture consisting of Li metal supported by an interconnected CuLix alloy nanowire network formed because of the phase separation, when the molten Li–Cu alloy cools down and gets solidified. Compared to the bare Li foil, the Li–Cu/CF anode shows a smaller polarization and better cycle stability in the carbonate electrolyte at various current densities ranging from 1 to 5 mA/cm2 and is free from dendrite growth upon repeated Li plating/stripping. This can be attributed to the low Li nucleation overpotential and high Coulombic efficiency (96%) during Li plating on and stripping from the thus-obtained hierarchically structured CF collector, as well as the higher proportion of Li2O relative to LiF in the solid-electrolyte interphase layer. Moreover, when assembled in a full cell paired with the LiFePO4 cathode, the Li–Cu/CF anode also exhibits much better rate capability and cycle performance than the bare Li foil.

The hardness and adhesion strength of coatings initially rise, peaking at 24 GPa and 44 N respectively, due to the formation of the nanocomposite structure. However, these properties decline as the coatings become fully amorphous. At elevated temperatures, severe oxidation leads to the gradual formation of layered oxides. Concurrently, phase transformation, spinodal decomposition, and crystallization occur within the nitride layer. The addition of Si enhances oxidation resistance by promoting the rapid formation of a dense and protective oxide layer, and by reducing nitrogen release and TiO2 formation. However, at 1000 and 1100 °C, the coating with 10 at.% Si exhibits slightly faster oxidation compared to the 6.8 at.% Si coating, as the increased Si content reduces the Al content, limiting the coating's ability to regenerate the protective oxide layer.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "AlCrTiN", "application": "high-temperature coatings", "props": {}}, "MAT2": {"name": "AlCrTiSiN (4 at.% Si)", "application": "high-temperature coatings", "props": {}}, "MAT3": {"name": "AlCrTiSiN (6.8 at.% Si)", "application": "high-temperature coatings", "props": {"hardness": "24 GPa", "adhesion strength": "44 N"}}, "MAT4": {"name": "AlCrTiSiN (10.6 at.% Si)", "application": "high-temperature coatings", "props": {"oxidation rate": "slightly faster than 6.8 at.% Si coating at 1000 and 1100 °C"}}}}

The PCM/FeP heterostructure was derived from the obtained carbon microspheres by Fe3+ absorbing, porosity activation and subsequent phosphorization. Firstly, 0.5 g of carbon spheres were dispersed in 25 mL of 2.5 M ferric nitrate water solution by 10 min of sonication and stirred for 6 h at room temperature to ensure uniform saturation of Fe3+ on the oxygen-containing functional groups. The suspension was then centrifuged, washed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C overnight. The dried powders were carbonized at 500 °C for 1 h under Ar in a tube furnace, followed by activation at 800 °C for 3 h under CO2 to obtain PCM/Fe3O4. The further phosphorization was performed at 550 °C for 3 h in Ar using sodium hypophosphite monohydrate as the phosphorous source (NaH2PO2·H2O: PCM/Fe3O4 = 20:1, w/w). FeP nanoparticles without the PCM skeleton were synthesized by annealing PCM/Fe3O4 in air at 600 °C for 3 h, followed by the same phosphorization process as PCM/FeP. To prepare the cathode composite, sulfur and PCM/FeP were mixed at the weight ratio of 75:25 and heated at 155 °C for 12 h to ensure homogeneous sulfur distribution. For contrast, sulfur composites based on PCM/Fe3O4 and PCM were also prepared following the same parameters. To demonstrate the effect of embedding FeP within the PCM microspheres, PCM and FeP nanoparticles were also mixed by grinding and then subjected to sulfur loading using the same method as above. 2.2 Materials characterization Phase identifications of the prepared samples were performed by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD, BRUKER D8 Advance) using a Cu kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the surface chemistry of the materials by using a THERMO SCIENTIFIC ESCALAB 250XI spectrometer equipped with Al kα radiation. Surface morphologies and chemical compositions were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7800F). Microstructures and corresponding elemental analysis were performed on a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) operated at 200 kV.

For symmetrical cell, Li2S precipitation and decomposition measurements, active materials was mixed with poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder (PVDF) at a weight ratio of 4:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) to form homogeneous slurries, which were then coated on Al foil current collectors and dried at 55 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven to form the electrodes. Symmetric cells were assembled with identical electrodes of 12 mm in diameter as both the working and counter electrodes. A 0.2 M Li2S6 solution in DME/DOL (v/v = 1:1) containing 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) were used as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the symmetric cells were carried out at 3 mV s−1 and 200 mV s−1 within voltage ranges of −1.0 to +1.0 V and −0.8 to +0.8 V. Cells for Li2S precipitation and decomposition measurements were assembled with the above electrodes as working electrodes, 20 μL of 0.2 M Li2S8 in DME/DOL (v/v = 1:1) containing 1 M LiTFSI as the electrolyte, and lithium foils as the counter electrodes. Cells were discharged galvanostatically at 114 μA to 2.10 V and then potentiostatically discharged at 2.09 V to measure the Li2S precipitation current. For Li2S decomposition, the cells were first galvanostaticlly discharged in tew steps at 1.80 V to cutoff currents of 0.10 mA and 0.01 mA successively. The Li2S dissolution current and capacity were then measured by potentiostatically charging the cells at 2.40 V to a cutoff current of 0.01 mA. Li-S coin cells were assembled to evaluate the energy storage performance of the cathode composites. PCM/FeP/S (or PCM/Fe3O4/S, PCM/S), Super P carbon black and PVDF were mixed at the weight ratio of 8:1:1 and ground in NMP to form homogeneous slurries. The slurries were coated onto Al foils and dried at 55 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. Cathodes with areal sulfur loadings of 2.0 and 5.0 mg cm−2 were prepared and punched to 12 mm diameter discs. The electrolyte was 1 M LiTFSI in DME/DOL (v/v = 1:1) containing 0.2 M LiNO3. The electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio was controlled to be 8 μL mg−1 and 5 μL mg−1 for low (2.0 mg cm−2) and high (5.0 mg cm−2) areal sulfur loadings, respectively. The excess electrolyte amount in the low sulfur loading cells was necessary to ensure complete wetting of electrodes and separators. Lithium foils with 14 mm diameter was employed as the anodes, while Celgard 2400 porous polypropylene films with 19 mm diameter were used as separators. For Li-S pouch cells, each side of the Al foils were coated with PCM/FeP/S at the areal sulfur loading of 7 mg cm−2 and vacuum dried at 55 °C for 12 h. The prepared cathodes were punched to the size of 43 mm (W) × 56 mm (L) (Fig. S1a). Roll milled Li foils with the thickness of 0.1 mm were pressed on Cu foils and punched to 45 mm (W) × 58 mm (L) (Fig. S1b). Cathodes were wrapped by Celgard 2400 separators and then sandwiched by Li anodes on both sides. Al and Ni conductive tabs were ultrasonic welded on the cathodes and anodes respectively. Cells were assembled in laminated Al films and the electrolyte was 1 M LiTFSI dissolved in DME/DOL (v/v = 1:1) containing 0.2 M LiNO3. The E/S ratio was 4 μL mg−1. Electrolyte filled pouch cells were rested overnight and vacuum sealed under the pressure of 0.05 MPa. CV and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation. CV measurements of Li-S full cells were carried out within a voltage range of 1.6 to 2.9 V and EIS was conducted in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with a 10 mV AC amplitude. Galvanostatic discharge/charge tests were performed in a voltage range of 1.7 to 2.6 V on a multichannel battery testing system (NEWARE, BTS4000). 2.4 Solution phase Li2S6 adsorption test Sulfur and Li2S were mixed in DOL/DME (v/v = 1:1) with the molar radio of 5:1 and stirred at 65 °C for 48 h to form a 0.3 M Li2S6 solution. The obtained solution was further diluted in DOL/DME to 3 mM. 10 mg of adsorbents (PCM/FeP, PCM/Fe3O4 or PCM) was added to 4 mL of the above 3 mM Li2S6 solution and rested for 4 h for observation. 2.5 DFT calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package [41–44]. The projector augmented wave potentials were used to describe the electron–ion interactions and the Predew-Burke-Ernzerhor functional with generalized gradient approximation was employed to describe the electron exchange and correlation potentials [43–44]. The double numeric plus polarization basis set was used in the local atomic orbital basis set with a global orbital cutoff of 4.5 Å. A k-point mesh of 3*3*1 was used for the Brillouin-zone integrations. The model structures with adsorbed Li2S6 molecules were optimized until the maximum force is below 0.002 Ha/Å. During the geometry optimization, the graphite (002), FeP (011) and Fe3O4 (311) substrates were fixed. The Li2S6 adsorption energy E ad is defined as (1) E ad = E total - E subs - E mole where E total , E subs , and E mole denote the total energy, the energy of the substrate, and the energy of a free Li2S6 molecule, respectively.

However, poor oxygen reduction (ORR)/oxygen evolution (OER) kinetics involving Li2O2 formation/decomposition is a major obstacle to its development. By designing suitable cathode with desired structure and surface electronic states, the formation/morphology of Li2O2 and the reaction kinetics of charge process can be efficiently optimized simultaneously. In this work, a novel sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl) co-doped porous carbon (CSC) were synthesized by one-step pyrolysis strategy, and the amount of heterogeneous atoms could be flexibly controlled by different calcination temperatures. Experimental combined with theoretical calculations show that the content of CCl bond plays an important role in the adsorption of intermediate LiO2, thus regulating the morphology of Li2O2 and ultimately affecting the release of battery energy. The CS bond mainly acts on the dynamics of the ORR and OER processes, which has an important influence on improving the round-trip efficiency of the battery.

A metal ion recovery rate of 99.91%, 99.92%, and 99.84% has been achieved for Ni, Co and Mn, respectively.

The electrolysis setup featured a glass container with a Ti plate functioning as the anode, paired with a stainless-steel mesh serving as the cathode. To summarise, the electrolyte consisted of 0.13 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) and 0.02 M potassium phosphate (K3PO4) set at 5 °C throughout the experiments using a water-based thermostat for 600 s. A constant alternating electric current with a density of 100 mA cm−2 and a frequency of 500 Hz was used. The IL samples were cleaned with deionised water and ethanol several times before being dried in a warm air stream. To synthesise PANI, 5 mL of aniline, 50 mL of 0.25 M ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8), and 50 mL of 0.5 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were reacted in a −10 °C ice-bath until it became a green solution. H2SO4 was added dropwise during the reaction. Subsequently, 1 M ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) was used for washing during the filtration. The filtered solution was subjected to drying within a hot-air oven maintained at a temperature of 60 °C for a duration of 24 hours. After air-cooling in the ambient atmosphere, 1 g of the PANI polymer was dissolved in 30 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF). The inorganic layer coated with a polymer (ILP) was fabricated by the DCC method with an immersion time of 1 h. Therefore, the sample was cured inside a hot air oven at 100 °C for 5 h. Fig. 1 shows the chemical formulation of the PANI synthesis. 2.2 Characterisation The substrate microstructures were investigated by utilising field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi 4800) in combination with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Horiba, Inc.). The overall compositions were analysed through X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D-Max 2500) for these materials. Additionally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Perkin Elmer, Spectrum 100) was employed to confirm the probable bonding structures present within the coatings. The UV-Vis-NIR transmittance characteristics of the ILP were assessed by employing a spectrometer (Varian Cary 5000) spanning wavelengths from 300 to 800 nm. Furthermore, the water contact angles of the IL samples with and without PANI deposition were measured using a contact angle goniometer (SEO-Phoenix-300) from several areas under each condition. This was repeated three times to evaluate the reproducibility. 2.3 Electrochemical investigations The electrochemical performance of the ILP was studied using a three-electrode potentiostat (Gamry Interface 1010), where the working electrode featured an exposed area of 1 cm². The counter electrode was composed of platinum (Pt) while the reference electrode used was Ag/AgCl. After 2 hours of stabilisation, electrochemical tests were carried out at a stable open-circuit potential. Potentiodynamic polarisation tests were carried out from −0.4–0.4 V vs. the open-circuit potential at 1 mV s−1. EIS scans were performed from 106 to 0.1 Hz at 10 points per decade utilising a 10 mV rms AC perturbation.

After the solution had been bubbled with nitrogen for 10 min, 2 mL of 1 × 10–2 M N,N-dimethylselenourea (Aldrich) was added, and the mixture was heated in a conventional 900-W microwave oven for 50 s. All samples were characterized using electron microscopy analysis (transmission electron microscopy analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), particle size distribution by dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential (effective surface charge) analysis, and elemental composition by energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) mapping to elucidate their morphology, topography and composition. The nanoparticle’s optical properties were evaluated by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Electronic absorption spectra were acquired with a CARY 500 Scan UV-vis spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy analysis was conducted on a Hitachi 4800 instrument. Light scattering and zeta potential measurements were carried out on a Brookhaven Zeta PALS instrument.\nPhotocatalytic Conversion\nPhotocatalytic conversion of CO2 was monitored with an in-house designed solar-gas chambers equipped with gas inlet and outlet, optical window and sample stage holder that allowed evaluation of nanocatalysts for solar fuels applications. The type and amount of hydrocarbons and other gases generated through prolonged light-soaking was quantified by a gas-chromatograph.

The photocatalytic chamber used was strategically selected, allowing a direct gas analysis with the micro gas-chromatograph, without the need of intermediary sampling steps. Approximately 1 cm3 of gas was injected each time. Standard gases were used as control samples to accurately elucidate the peak composition.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods 2.1 Preparation of In2O3 nanoparticles The In2O3 nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. 2 mmol In(NO3)3·5H2O and 2 g urea were dissolved in the mixture solution of 35 mL diethylene glycol (DEG) and 2 mL deionized water. The mixed solution above was magnetically stirred for 3 h, transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and heated at 180 °C for 24 h to obtain the precipitate. The as-prepared precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol and dried by a vacuum freeze dryer to obtain the In2O3 nanoparticles. 2.2 Preparation of In2O3-x@CS-0.4/0.5/0.6/0.7 and carbon sphere (CS) 200 mg of In2O3 and (80, 100, 120, and 140 mg of glucose were dispersed in 7 mL deionized water. The solution was magnetically stirred for 1 h and then heated at 180 ℃ for 8 h. After that, the corresponding as-prepared precipitates (In2O3-x@CS-X, the X represents the mass ratio of glucose to In2O3, X = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7) were obtained by washed with deionized water and dried by the vacuum freeze. CS was prepared by the same method without In2O3 nanoparticles. 2.3 Synthesis of modified separators The modified separators were fabricated by filtering the mixed solution onto the PP separators with a vacuum pump. The uniform mixed solution, consisting of 5 mg powder prepared above, respectively, 1 mg rGO, 20 mg polyethylene pyrrolidone (PVP), one 15 μL triton (X-100, Aladdin), and 100 mL deionized water, was obtained by an ultrasonic cell pulverizer. Then, the separators were freeze-dried for 12 h and cut into a disk with a diameter of 18 mm. The mass loading of the In2O3 and In2O3-x@CS on the coating layer is about 0.8 mg cm−2. 2.4 Characterization The synthesized powders were tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8 ADVANCE) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The morphologies and particle sizes were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI VERIOS460) and field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM; JEOL JEMF200 (HR)). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+) and Raman Spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution) were applied to investigate the XPS and Raman spectra, respectively. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET; Micromeritics ASAP 2460) was used to measure the specific surface areas of the obtained powders, under nitrogen at 77 K. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of polysulfide adsorption tests were collected with a Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600PLUS220/230VC; SHIMADZU). Oxygen vacancy was carried out on electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR, Germany Bruker A300-9.5/12). 2.5 Electrochemical tests The cathode electrode was obtained by mixing the sulfur-carbon compound (78% of sulfur), Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF), and carbon black (XFI15, Nanjing/Jiangsu XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd) in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent at the mass ratio of 8:1:1 with magnetic stirring for 3 h. Then the slurry was coated onto the aluminum foil, dried overnight at 60 ℃, and cut into a disk with a diameter of 12 mm (1.13 cm−2). The coin cells (CR2025) were assembled in a glove box under Ar atmosphere, using lithium foil, pure or modified polypropylene films, and LiTFSI (1.0 M), LiNO3 (0.2 M) insolvent of DOL/DME (1:1, v/v) as the anode, separator, and electrolyte, respectively. The galvanostatic charge-discharge performance of the battery was measured by the Neware test system, with the voltage window of 1.7–2.8 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were observed on the electrochemical workstation (CHI 608E) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were tested with the frequency range of 100 kHz–10 mHz. 2.6 Li2S precipitation experiments Various samples were coated onto carbon papers as cathodes while a lithium foil was used as the counter electrodes. Li2S8 solution was prepared by mixing sulfur and Li2S at a molar ratio of 7:1 in tetraglyme at 60 °C for 24 h. 10 μL of Li2S8 solution was dropped on the cathode and the 10 μL of pure electrolyte was added to the lithium anode side. The cells were galvanostratically discharge at 0.112 mA to 2.06 V and then kept potentiostatically at 2.02 V for nucleate and growth until the current dropped below 10−5 A. The cumulative charge energy was gathered to evaluate the nucleation/growth rate of Li2S according to Faraday's law. 2.7 Symmetrical cell assembly and measurements The working electrodes for symmetrical cells were assembled without the presence of sulfur. A homogeneous slurry was formed by mixing each sample and PVDF binder at a weight ratio of 3:1 in NMP. After that, coating the slurry onto carbon fiber paper as two identical electrodes. The amount of electrolyte is 40 μL (DOL/DME (v/v = 1/1)) solution of 0.5 mol L−1 Li2S6 and 1 mol L−1 LiTFSI with a 0.2 mol L−1 LiNiO3 additive). 2.8 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations The computations were performed based on the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The GGA exchange-correlation function was described by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE). Numerical convergence was accomplished with thresholds of 10−5 eV in energy and 0.02 eV/ A ( o ) in force under considerable cutoff energy of 500 eV. The SCF K-points were 2 × 2 × 1 with a vacuum space of 20 A ( o ) and the Smearing width was set of 0.2 eV. Furthermore, the van der Waals interaction was described by the Grimme DFT-D2 dispersion correction method. The adsorption energies ( E d ) of Li2Sx (x = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) on material surfaces were calculated by the equation, E d = E s u f + L i 2 S x − E s u f − E L i 2 S x .

Therefore, finding a suitable nanomaterial spacer is crucial to optimizing the sluggish diffusion kinetic of MXene-based composite films.

Anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2), Sudan red G, n-hexane, dichloromethane, toluene, heptane, soybean oil, n-hexadecane, and n-dodecane were from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDS) and methyl orange (MO) were purchased from Shanghai Jizi Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. DW was homemade from an ultrapure water dispenser for laboratory use. 2.2 Preparation of CSTM aerogels The CSTM aerogels were prepared by combining TiO2/MWCNTs nanocomposites with polysaccharide matrices, as shown in Fig. 1 . First, 0.1 g of commercial TiO2 was ultrasonically dispersed in 100 mL of MWCNTs suspension solution (0.5 g/L). Then under vigorous stirring, CMC and SA were dissolved into an optimal stock solution of 2.0 wt%, where the weight ratio of CMC/SA (m/m) was 1/1, dissolved in the above suspension to obtain a homogeneous TiO2/MWCNTs/CMC/SA mixture, followed by freeze-drying of the mixed solution at −58 °C for 24 h. The aerogel obtained after freeze-drying was immersed in a solution (m(CaCl2): m(AE): m(DW) = 2:80:20) for 12 h to allow for calcium ion-induced cross-linking process. And freeze-dried again to finalize the CSTM aerogel. According to the same method, CMC/SA (CS), and CMC/SA@TiO2 (CST) aerogels were also prepared for comparison. 2.3 Characterization The microstructure of the aerogels was investigated by using a Hitachi SU 8000 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Bio-Rad FTS-165), the chemical groups and molecular structure were examined. The roughness of the aerogel surface and the size of the oil droplets were measured using a three-dimensional digital microscope (VHX-6000, Japan). Contact angle and dynamic adhesion behavior were measured using a contact angle analyzer (DSA25S, Germany). The specific surface area of the aerogels was investigated by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements using a fully automated specific surface and porosity analyzer BET (Conta AUTOSORB IQ, USA). Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi), the chemical makeup of the various aerogels was examined. To test the mechanical properties of the aerogel, the sample size of the aerogel was cylindrical with a diameter of 30 mm and a height of 15 mm, and the mechanical properties of the composite aerogel were measured by a universal material testing machine (UTM2203, China) at 25 °C and 30 % relative humidity, with a test speed of 10 mm/min until a preset strain of 80 %.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "This study proposes a 1 kW power converter of the lithium battery charging system for electric vehicles. Its proposed architecture comprises an interleaved boost power factor corrector (PFC) converter and a full-bridge phase-shift (FBPS) converter with a new two poles and two zeros (TPTZ) digital compensation function. Unlike the traditional one pole and one zero compensation control, the proposed TPTZ compensation control considers both the output voltage and the output current feedback, effectively controlling the gain bandwidth fc and phase margin PM and improving system stability and performance. The interleaved boost PFC converter can adjust the power factor close to 1.0. On the other hand, the FBPS converter adopts an average switching model and the duty cycle loss factor to derive the small-signal model of the full-bridge phase-shift converter. The model can obtain the transfer function of the output voltage and current to the duty cycle. The corresponding digital compensation control loop was designed and applied to the converters using the derived transfer function. Further, the charge system's stability with MATLAB simulation was verified. Finally, the proposed architecture with the proposed TPTZ control method was compared with the traditional battery charger architecture, in which the PFC converter was connected with an FBPS converter in series. The study found that the proposed battery charging system performs better than the traditional system under the test conditions (25 %, 50 %, and 100 % load). In addition, the proposed TPTZ method has 95 % and 96 % efficiency when charging with constant voltage mode and constant current mode at 100 % load, respectively. Furthermore, this study proposes a battery charging system with a TPTZ digital compensation function that not only improves system performance but also reduces circuit size, suitable for charging lithium batteries in electric vehicles.", "output": {}}

However, poor cycling stability, low round trip efficiency, and over charge potential during cycling are the major shortcomings for their future applications. In this work, a soluble redox mediator integrated into a polymer electrolyte provides immediate access to the solid discharged product, lowering the energy barrier for reversible Li2O2 generation and disintegration. Moreover, introducing a redox mediator to the polymer electrolyte boosts the ORR during discharge and the OER during the recharge process. The synergistic redox mediator pBQ (1,4 benzoquinone) dramatically reduces the over-potential. A small proportion of pBQ in the polymer electrolyte allows Li2O2 to develop in a thin film-like morphology on the cathode surface, resulting in a high reversible capacity of ∼12 000 mA h g−1 and an extended cycling stability of 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1 with a cut-off capacity of 1000 mA h g−1. The remarkable cell performance is attributed to the fast kinetics of para benzoquinone for the ORR and OER in Li–O2 batteries.

A structural study via XRD shows that the tetragonal rutile structure of SnO2 is maintained. Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman studies confirm the existence of SnO2 along with CNTs and Ni nanoparticles. The electrochemical performance was investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements. The nanocomposite has been used as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The SnO2/Ni/CNT nanocomposite exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 5312 mA h g−1 and a corresponding charge capacity of 2267 mA h g−1 during the first cycle at 50 mA g−1. Pristine SnO2 showed a discharge/charge capacity of 1445/636 mA h g−1 during the first cycle at 50 mA g−1. This clearly shows the effects of the optimum concentrations of CNTs and Ni. Further, the nanocomposite (SnNiCn) shows a discharge capacity as high as 919 mA h g−1 after 210 cycles at a current density of 400 mA g−1 in a Li-ion battery set-up. Thus, the obtained capacity from the nanocomposite is much higher compared to pristine SnO2. The higher capacity in the nanoheterostructure is due to the well-dispersed nanosized Ni-decorated stabilized SnO2 along with the CNTs, avoiding pulverization as a result of the volumetric change of the nanoparticles being minimized. The material accommodates huge volume expansion and avoids the agglomeration of nanoparticles during the lithiation and delithiation processes. The Ni nanoparticles can successfully inhibit Sn coarsening during cycling, resulting in the enhancement of stability during reversible conversion reactions. They ultimately enhance the capacity, giving stability to the nanocomposite and improving performance. Additionally, the material exhibits a lower Warburg coefficient and higher Li ion diffusion coefficient, which in turn accelerate the interfacial charge transfer process; this is also responsible for the enhanced stable electrochemical performance.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Titanium dioxide was purchased from the Macklin Corporation (Shanghai, China). Absolute ethanol, methyl orange, diethylenetriamine (DETA), dimethylformamide (DMF), and natural graphite flakes (325 mesh) were obtained from the Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin, China). Potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 98 wt%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were purchased from Heowns Biochem Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were provided by the Fengchuan Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin, China). In addition, deionized water (DI) was used throughout the synthesis. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of NGO GO was synthesized by the Hummers method utilizing graphite powder. NGO was obtained through the polycondensation reaction of GO and DETA with EDC and NHS as cross-linking agents [12]. Specifically, GO was exfoliated uniformly in DMF by ultrasonication for two hours, and then, the suspension solution was shifted into a reaction kettle while the cross-linking agents EDC and NHS were added at a reaction temperature below 5 °C. A 300 r/min reactor stirring speed was controlled for five hours, and then, DETA was added dropwise to the suspension solution. Subsequently, the rotor was rotated vigorously at 600 r/min at ambient temperature. After stirring for six hours, the semifinished product of NGO was obtained. The mixed solution was centrifuged three times with deionized water to remove impurities. After being dried in a vacuum freeze dryer, the final product was sealed and stored. 2.3 Preparation of the NGO-TiO2 composite catalyst A suitable amount of NGO was sieved by a 150/300-mesh sieve to achieve uniform distribution, and then, the NGO was added to deionized water and sonicated for one hour to obtain a homogeneous solution (Fig. 1 (1)). TiO2 could be dispersed uniformly in the toluene solution by the same treatment (Fig. 1 (1)). The suspension solution of NGO and the toluene solution of TiO2 were mixed, and sodium dodecyl sulfonate was added as an activator (Fig. 1 (2)). NGO-TiO2 (5/95, 10/90, 20/80 and 30/70) was prepared by self-assembly at the two-phase interface during magnetic stirring for five hours at ambient temperature (Fig. 1 (3)). The precipitate was centrifuged and washed with acetone, and then, it was necessary to wash twice with deionized water [13]. Finally, the product was dried in a vacuum freeze dryer to obtain the final composite photocatalyst. The comparison groups of GO-TiO2 and undispersed NGO-TiO2 composite catalysts were prepared by the same procedures as above [14]. A schematic diagram of self-assembling NGO-TiO2 is shown in Fig. 1. 2.4 Characterizations The crystalline phases and structures of the prepared composite catalysts were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) from 10° to 80° (D8 Discover and D8 Advance, Bruker AXS Co., USA). The chemical elements and functional groups of the samples were analysed using a Genesis 60S X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) system (EDAX Inc., Mahwah, NJ, USA) with a Mg-Kα radiation source. A Bruker Tensor Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FT-IR, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co, Germany) was used to explore the chemical groups of the prepared samples. The morphologies of the catalyst were observed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (H7650, Hitachi, Japan). The absorbance of the prepared composite materials was confirmed by ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrometry (TU-1901, Purkinje General Instrument, Beijing, China) at an absorption wavelength of 464 nm. The surface areas and pore size distribution were measured by BET analysis (Autosorb-iQ-C, USA) with N2 as the adsorptive gas. 2.5 Adsorption test Ten milligrams of GO, NGO, and 150/300-mesh screened NGO was placed into three beakers separately, and 100 ml of 10 mg/L methyl orange solution was added. Under the condition of darkness, the solution was stirred magnetically for five hours at a speed of 300 r/min, and a 3 ml sample was removed every 30 min [15]. The absorbance of the solution was measured using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer. The concentration change in the methyl orange solution was measured using the standard curve [16]. The adsorption amount ( q e , mg/g) was calculated by the formula (Eq. (1)) according to the variation between the initial stage and the residual concentration at time t. At least three repeated measurements are necessary to ensure the reliability of the data. (1) q e = V C 0 - C t / m where C 0 (mg/L) is the initial concentration, C t (mg/L) is the concentration of the solution at time t, V (L) is the volume of the solution, and m (g) is the mass of the adsorbent [17]. 2.6 Photocatalytic experiments The photocatalytic degradation experiments of methyl orange removal were characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy at an absorption wavelength of 464 nm with simulated solar irradiation (Xenon 21A, 300 W lamp solar simulator) as the excitation light source. A cooling water circulation system was needed to reduce the evaporation of the test solution during light irradiation. The distance between the excitation light source and the test solution was 30 cm. The catalyst was added to the methyl orange solution before light irradiation, and then, the mixed solution was stirred magnetically for three hours in the dark to achieve adsorption equilibrium. The samples (3 ml) were removed every 30 min. After centrifugation, the absorbance of the solution-removed suspended catalysts was tested with an ultraviolet–visible spectrometer [18].

Air-cooled thermal management systems offer advantages in durability and simplicity. Here, we demonstrate a novel air-cooled system in which cooling features are integrated directly into the prismatic battery cells. When cells are stacked in a battery module, the topographic features integrated into the battery case contact each other and provide mechanical resistance against deformation due to internal battery pressure as well as form a plurality of cooling channels. A series of finite element analyses and conjugate heat transfer analyses are performed to identify the optimal geometric parameters for the design concept under consideration of both battery cell internal pressure and thermal loading. For a wide spacing between fins, the cooling efficiency is high when battery internal pressure is absent but low in the presence of cell deformation due to battery internal pressure. As the number of additional fins is increased, the effect of deformation on cooling performance decreases. Consequently, there exists an optimal number of cooling fins. The utilization of tapered channels and the addition of secondary fins provides additional and significant improvements in temperature uniformity, however at cost of increased pressure drop and maximum temperature compared with the design of parallel channels. This study seeks to make two contributions. One contribution is a fundamental one in heat transfer. It addresses the performance of heat sinks under consideration of mechanical deformation of the heat sink. The other contribution is related to battery thermal management.

Commercial 18650 lithium-ion cells are used to validate the PA method. Comparing two entropy profiles measured by PA method and conventional potentiometric method (CPM), the result clearly shows that the PA method maintains comparable accuracy to CPM with an average error of ± 0.01 mV/K.

The novelty of the present study lies in formulating a natural doping concept over the conventional techniques to facilitate the photocatalytic properties of the proposed sustainable construction material. To assess the structural performance of the prepared cementitious material, i.e., cement mortar, different physical (porosity, water absorption, and density) and mechanical (compressive strength, flexural strength, and split tensile strength) properties were performed. The results show that the cement mortar mixture FB5F having 15% (10% FA and 5% BS) proportion of conventional cement performed better in terms of workability and durability than other mix designs. Also, the stability and potency of the Fe–TiO2 composite were analyzed using FESEM, EDS, elemental mapping, UV–vis DRS, and XRD. The characterization tests confirmed the iron-titanium (ITO) bond formation with shifting TiO2 from UV to visible light spectrum (Eg = 2.52 eV).

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental details 2.1 Synthesis of catalyst powders Chemical reduction method was used to synthesize the desired catalysts. An aqueous solution of cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2.6H2O, 0.05 M) and sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) was prepared. Under vigorous stirring, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was added to the above solution. To ensure complete reduction of cobalt chloride, the molar ratio of (B + P)/Co was kept three for all experiments. As the reaction is spontaneous, effervescence is noticed due to liberation of H2 gas and the solution turns black immediately. This mixture is continuously stirred for 15 min until the effervescence ceases. The resulting mixture is centrifuged to separate the black powder and is washed thoroughly with double distilled water (DDW) and then finally with alcohol to remove the remnant impurities. To obtain different molar ratio of B/P in Co-P-B catalyst, the molar concentrations of NaBH4 and NaH2PO2 were varied. Co-B powder was also synthesized using a similar method, without using NaH2PO2. Co-P powder was synthesized using CoCl2.6H2O (0.1 M) as the precursor while NaH2PO2 (1 M) was used as the reducing agent. The reaction temperature is maintained at 90 °C and pH is adjusted to 11 with the help of 30 wt.% NaOH aqueous solution. After 30 min of vigorous stirring, the resulting black powder was first washed with 8% aqueous ammonia and then repeatedly washed with DDW and finally with alcohol to ensure complete removal of the impurities. 2.2 Characterization of catalyst powders Surface morphology of the catalyst powders was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI INSPECT F50) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) (FEI Tecnai G2, F30, 300 kV). HR–TEM images and selective area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were also obtained to determine the particle size distribution and crystallinity of the prepared catalyst powders. Structural characterization of the catalyst powders was done by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku Ultima IV, Cu Kα radiation with λ = 1.5414 Ǻ) in θ-2θ configuration. To determine the surface area of the catalyst powders, a multi-point BET with N2 adsorption method was used. The adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained after 2 h of degassing the samples at 423 K. To study the composition and electronic states of the catalyst surface, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI 5000 Versaprobe-II) was used. XPS data was recorded at room temperature using spectrophotometer calibrated with Au 4f7/2 line positioned at 83.8 eV. Al Kα radiation at 1486.6 eV was used for ejecting the photoelectrons from the sample surface. The C 1s line positioned at 284.8 eV was recorded during each scan as internal calibration to ensure the absence of any charging effect. Inductive coupled plasma – Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH) was used to quantify the elemental composition of the developed catalysts. To carry out post-HER and post-OER characterizations, the sample was scraped off from the surface of glassy carbon electrode after long-term potentiostatic tests for HER and OER. 2.3 Preparation of electrodes 3 mm glassy carbon (GC) electrode (CH instruments) was used for the deposition of catalyst powders. For deposition, well dispersed homogenous ink was prepared by sonication of each catalyst powder (2 mg) in 2 ml ethanol. 20 μl of Nafion (5%) was sonicated in 0.5 ml of ethanol to prepare a homogenous binder solution. On polished GC, initially 10 μl of Nafion binder solution is drop-casted evenly and dried under IR lamp. After this layer, 20 μl of catalyst ink is drop-casted uniformly and dried under IR lamp. A catalyst loading of 0.3 mg/cm2 was maintained for all the depositions. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements For electrochemical activity measurements, a potentiostat system from CH instruments (660D) was used with a 3-electrode cell configuration. Catalyst loaded GC was used as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as reference and a Pt electrode (CH Instruments) was used as counter. 1 M NaOH (pH 14) was used as the electrolyte for all measurements. For measurements in acidic and neutral media, 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.5 M potassium phosphate (KPi) solutions were used, respectively. Prior to polarization measurements for HER, a potentiostatic sweep was conducted until the resultant current is stabilised. This ensures removal of any oxidation layer formed on the catalyst surface. All the linear polarization measurements for both HER and OER were performed at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. For all the catalyst powders, uncompensated resistance (Rs) was determined with the help of impedance spectroscopy (Nyquist plot) and the same value was used for overpotential (ƞ) calculations. All the potentials were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by adding the value of 1.068 (for pH14) obtained from Nernst equation E = Eo + (0.059*pH) where Eo = 0.241 V for saturated calomel electrode [29]. From the plot of “log(i) vs ƞ”, Tafel slope and exchange current density values were obtained. Turnover frequency (TOF) values were calculated using the procedure mentioned in a previous work [26]. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans were performed for Co-P-B (B/P = 5), Co-B and Co-P in 1 M NaOH to determine the electrochemically active surface area. For this purpose, CV scans at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mV/sec) were performed within the potential range of -0.35 to -0.15 V (vs RHE). From these plots, the difference in anodic and cathodic current densities (Δj) at -0.25 V (vs RHE) was plotted against the corresponding scan rates. The slope of the line obtained by linear fit is twice the value of the double layer capacitance (CDL) at the interface of electrolyte and catalyst [30].", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Co-P-B", "Syns_method": "chemical reduction", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "CoCl2·6H2O", "amount": "0.05 M"}}, "parameters": {"time": "15 min"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "centrifugation"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "washing", "substances": [{"name": "DDW"}, {"name": "alcohol"}]}, "post_proc3": {"step": "drying"}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Co-B", "Syns_method": "chemical reduction", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "CoCl2·6H2O", "amount": "0.05 M"}}, "parameters": {"time": "15 min"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "centrifugation"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "washing", "substances": [{"name": "DDW"}, {"name": "alcohol"}]}, "post_proc3": {"step": "drying"}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "Co-P", "Syns_method": "chemical reduction", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "CoCl2·6H2O", "amount": "0.1 M"}, "prc2": {"name": "NaH2PO2", "amount": "1 M"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent1": {"reagent": "NaOH", "amount": "30 wt.% aqueous solution", "ph": "11"}}, "parameters": {"temperature": "90 °C", "time": "30 min"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "washing", "substances": [{"name": "8% aqueous ammonia"}, {"name": "DDW"}, {"name": "alcohol"}]}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Material and methods 2.1 Raw materials and reagent Rod-like Wollastonite is grinding powder from Jilin Province, China. According to the XRD pattern of wollastonite (Fig. 4a), only the characteristic peaks of wallstonite can be seen, indicating its high purity. NanoTiO2 is a commercial Degussa product (P25) composed of anatase and rutile mixed crystal phases. 2.2 Preparation of WOT-PC Wollastonite and nanoTiO2 with certain mass ratios were mixed with water into suspension. Then, the two kinds of suspensions with ceramic balls were put into a GSDM-03 superfine grinding mill for 60 min. Finally, separating the slurry from ceramic balls, filtration, and drying out were performed to obtain WOT-PC. WOT-PC-X was noted as the different composite proportions(X%) of nanoTiO2. 2.3 Photocatalytic degradation performance on methyl orange Methyl orange solution was used as the target pollutant to investigate the photocatalytic degradation performance of WOT-PC. A mercury lamp with a main wavelength of 254 nm and power of 300 W was used as the ultraviolet light source. According to the requirement that the mass fraction of WOT-PC in the solution is 10 g/L, WOT-PC was added to the methyl orange solution at a concentration of 10 mg/L (C0) to obtain the suspension. The tube containing the suspension was placed in a photocatalytic reaction apparatus. After a 30 min dark reaction, the light source was turned on for the degradation reaction. After degradation, the suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was taken to measure the absorbance. Then, the residual concentration of methyl orange in the solution (C) was obtained through the relationship between absorbance and concentration. The photocatalytic degradation performance of the samples was characterized and evaluated by the changes in C/C0. According to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood dynamic equation, ln (C/C0) = -kt, the linear regression between -ln(C/C0) and t (illumination time) was performed, where the photocatalytic degradation rate was characterized by the value of its linear slope (k). A Cary 5000 UV–Vis spectrophotometer (USA, Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to measure absorbance. 2.4 Wettability test of WOT-PC and self-cleaning test of WOT-PC coating 2.4.1 Test of water contact angle The whole process is shown in Fig. 1 . In the tablet press, the WOT-PC powder was pressed into a sheet sample with a smooth surface at a pressure of 10–15 MPa, and then the sample was glued on the glass slide with double-sided adhesive. The slides were fixed upside down on the upper part of the transparent container full of water, and a syringe was used to inject air below the sample to form bubbles. When the bubbles were stably attached to the sample surface, a Contact Angle tester (JC2000D, Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Polytechnic Apparatus Co.) was used to photograph bubbles. According to the photos, the contact angles (θ) of the gas-liquid interface were measured 3 times to calculate the average value. The smaller the θ value is, the stronger the hydrophilicity of the sample. When the value reaches 5°, the samples are believed to be superhydrophilic. 2.4.2 Self-cleaning test of WOT-PC coating After adding 50 mg WOT-PC into a 5 mL alcohol solution, a suspension with a solid content of 10 mg/mL was obtained by ultrasonic dispersion. Then, the suspension was sprayed on the surface of a coating film adhering to the colour card paper to obtain a WOT-PC coating after natural drying. By a syringe, 2 mL rhodamine B (10 mg/L) solution as an organic pollutant was dropped onto the WOT-PC coating surface and then exposed to UV light and outdoor sunlight for 30 min and 60 min, respectively. Before and after irradiation, the CIE chromophore values at the rhodamine B areas on the WOT-PC coating surface were tested. The removal efficiency of rhodamine B was characterized by the value of a*, which represents the change in red colour. For comparison, the a* values of the coating film without the WOT-PC coating were also measured by only dripping rhodamine B solution under the light. 2.5 Characterization of photocatalysts The phase analysis of WOT-PC-Xs was carried out by X-ray diffraction (D/MAX2000, Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The morphology of WOT-PC-Xs was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (S–3500 N, Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The surface functional groups were examined by infrared spectroscopy (Spectrum 100, PerkinElmer Instruments (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., China) using KBr as the background. The binding energies between the elements were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific Escalab 250XI) with Al Kα radiation and an operating voltage of 200 W. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, HITACHI, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 201 nm. UV–Vis spectra were obtained between 200 and 800 nm on a TU-1901 double beam spectrophotometer.

A total of 12 cubes of cement paste are made with each cube volume of 351.89 cm3 (cube dimensions: 70.6 ×   70.6  × 70.6 mm). Consistency test is carried out for OPC grade 43 which is found to be 32%. After casting, 24 h is allowed for natural setting before putting them in to water for curing. Mechanical properties (compressive and flexural) are studied after standard curing time of 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. Capacity of Compression Testing Machine (CTM) is 2000kN, and rate of loading for compression is 0.6kN/sec. The compressive strength (CS) is determined using the relation, CS = P/A, where P = maximum or ultimate load, and A = cross-sectional area of sample cube (= 49.84 cm2 in this case). Flexural strength (Fs) is measured on the beam with dimensions of 100 × 100 × 500 mm. Flexural strength measurement is carried out by placing the specimen beam in middle of the supports (2-point loading) (Fig. 1). Modulus of rupture or flexural strength is given by, Fs (MPa) = (P × L)/(B × D2), where P = load when specimen fails (kN≡ kilo Newton), D = depth of beam specimen (mm), L = minimum distance between the edge and breaking point, B = width of specimen beam.\nTable 1 Oxide and metal nanoparticle-based OPC cement composites at different wt.% of oxides or metal nanoparticles.

Crystallite sizes of oxide and metal nanoparticles are calculated from the peak diffraction of respective nanoparticle using Scherrer's formula (Ref 36). Photocatalytic study is carried out on OPC, OPC-Fe2O3, OPC-TiO2, OPC-Cu cement composites using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda 35). Small part of sample cube cured at 28 days is finely ground using mortar and pastel. In 80 ml deionized water (DI water), 25 mg of finely ground powder of each composite sample (OPC, OPC-Fe2O3, OPC-TiO2, OPC-Cu) is dispersed and ultrasonicated for 1 min. 25 mg of rhodamine-6G is added in 100 ml DI water. Next, 20 ml of rhodamine solution is added separately to the 80 ml sample solution of OPC, OPC-Fe2O3, OPC-TiO2, OPC-Cu. Thus, a total of four separate solution mixtures (100 ml each) are prepared. All the solution mixtures are exposed to 100 W visible light (bulb is kept 10 cm away from the solution surface) with frequent stirring using glass rod. UV–Vis absorption spectra are recorded for each solution to record spectral response. Before visible light exposure, the recorded spectra are treated as references. Subsequently, after every 1 h exposure spectra are recorded to monitor exposure-dependent dye degradation.", "output": {}}

During the USER reaction, the generated gas was collected by a sealed tube covering the GO film, and then injected into a gas chromatograph (SRI 8610C). A Netzsch STA 449 instrument was used for thermogravimetric analysis at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.

All the chemicals and reagents were used as received. Various target test gases to detect sensing response were procured from Southern gas limited, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.\n2.2 Fabrication of gas sensing films\n2.2.1 Preparation of PDMS substrates\nOne of the most important criteria towards fabrication of flexible/stretchable sensing films is the choice of suitable substrate that determines the degree of flexibility/stretchability along term durability of the sensing films. Owing to its thermal expansion coefficient, non-toxic, intrinsic stretchability (small elastic modulus of ~ 1.8 MPa), thermal stability, chemical resistance to harsh environments, easy processability, and hydrophobicity, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has received overwhelming response as a substrate in flexible/stretchable substrates in wearable devices [43]. Due to these superior features, we have chosen PDMS as a substrate to develop flexible/stretchable sensing films in this study. In our study, glass sheets were used as base molds to prepare thick PDMS films, and the glass sheets were made hydrophobic before using them for spin coating. For the pretreatment of glass sheets, they were soaked in concentrated H2SO4 and H2O2 for ~ 30 min, respectively, followed by washing with DI water and blowing nitrogen vapor. PDMS films were spin coated on glass substrates of dimensions 3 cm × 3 cm which were pre cleaned with DI water, ethanol, and UV treated to improve the hydrophobicity. Thick PDMS films on pre-treated glass sheets were prepared by spin coating at 500 rpm for 60 s as reported [44]. After solidification of the films at 75 °C for 1 h, uniform freestanding PDMS films were peeled off from the glass sheets.\n2.2.2 Preparation of PEDOT–PSS and PEDOT–PSS:DEG-TiO2 composite films over PDMS\nTitanium dioxide nanopowder (TiO2) was mixed with ethanol and the solution was sonicated for 2 h to achieve uniform dispersion of TiO2 in ethanol. To the as-received PEDOT–PSS dispersion, diethylene glycol was added (9:1) and sonicated for 2 h to obtain homogeneous dispersion of PEDOT–PSS and DEG at room temperature. Nanocomposite solutions of PEDOT–PSS:DEG and TiO2 were prepared with varying content of TiO2 (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wt%) and further sonicated for 2 h to obtain the uniform dispersion of these nanocomposite solution. The thick PDMS films prepared above were further UV treated to improve their hydrophobicity and used to coat PEDOT–PSS:DEG-TIO2 nanocomposite solution. Pure PEDOT–PSS, PEDOT–PSS with DEG, and PEDOT–PSS:DEG-TiO2 nanocomposites (with varying content of TiO2) were bar-coated onto thick PDMS substrates (as illustrated in schematic diagram-Fig. 1). The films were annealed at 100 °C to remove the moisture and water content from it, a pair of gold (Au) electrodes were thermally deposited using a mask aligner and copper wires were connected to the electrodes for electrical and sensor response measurements.\nFig. 1\nSchematic representation of preparing flexible and stretchable sensing films\nFull size image\n2.3 Characterization techniques\nThe surface morphology of pure PEDOT–PSS and PEDOT–PSS:DEG-TiO2 thin films was recorded using “Zeiss Ultra-60 (Japan) scanning electron microscope. The TEM images of the prepared thin films were obtained using JEM-2100 (China) transmission electron microscope. Different functional groups and chemical compositions of the films were investigated using Thermo-Nicolet 6700 FT-IR (Japan) spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction patterns of the powdered samples were performed using X’Pert pro X-ray diffractometer with nickel filter. Diffraction data were obtained by exposing the samples to Cu-Kα radiation of wavelength of 1.5414 Å. The thermal stability of the samples was carried out using an NETSCH STA-409PC thermal analyzer. The temperature-dependent conductivity of the films was studied by two-probe method using Keithley 6487 picoammeter/voltmeter in at room temperature. The gas sensing measurements were performed on the PEDOT–PSS and PEDOT–PSS:DEG-TiO2 films deposited on PDMS under static conditions (40 ± 5% RH, room temperature) in a sealed borosilicate glass chamber of volume 250 cm3. Target gas sources were mixed with the flux of synthetic air 2 L/min, at different flow rate ratios and concentrations using mass flow control meters. The sensors were tested under mechanical deformation such as bending and stretching in the presence of NO gas and the data were continuously recorded and analyzed through I-V parameters using custom data acquisition tool LabView graphic interface.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials synthesis TNTM/Pt/AuNW electrodes were synthesized via a multi-step process that combined anodizing of the titanium foil, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of platinum, and electrodeposition of gold. This was followed by a detachment of the entire system from the metal substrate. The key synthesis steps are illustrated in Fig. 1 a–d. To create the thin film photocatalysts, a series of titania nanotube arrays were fabricated using a three-step electrochemical anodizing of Ti substrates (Advent, thickness of 0.125 mm, purity of 99.6%). Before anodizing, the Ti substrates were degreased by sequential sonication in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 15 min each, then drying with an air stream. Non-anodized regions of the sample were protected with peelable paint. To enhance nanotube alignment, a three-step anodizing method was employed. It is a well-known approach for improving the ordering of nanotubes [20]. All steps were conducted in an agitated (750 rpm) ethylene glycol-based (≥99.7%, VWR) electrolyte containing 3% vol. deionized (DI) water and 0.15 M NH4F (≥98%, VWR). A cooling system maintained the electrolyte temperature at 20 °C during the process. Electrooxidation was performed using a direct current (DC) power source (Voltcraft PPS-11815) set to 60 V within a two-electrode setup with a platinum counter electrode. After the first (1 h) and second (30 min) anodizing steps, samples were washed in water, and intermediate oxide layers were removed from the metal substrate with Scotch tape. The thickness of the nanotube layers was controlled by adjusting the third anodizing time to 20, 30, and 40 min, resulting in oxide films with thicknesses of 6.8, 10.7, and 13 μm, respectively (Fig. S1). The thickness of the nanotube layer is denoted in the sample name by appending the anodizing time to the TNT abbreviation. After the final (3rd) anodizing step, the specimens were first rinsed in ethanol and directly transferred to warm 70 °C ethanol on a hot plate with magnetic stirring (250 rpm) to remove residual electrolyte. The samples were then subjected to the warm air drying. Subsequently, a thermal annealing process in the air at 450 °C for 1 h was conducted in a muffle furnace to transform the amorphous nanotubes into the anatase structure (Fig. 1a). The crystalline titania nanotubes on the titanium substrate produced in the preceding stage were subjected to a short anodizing step to create a thin amorphous TiO2 layer beneath them (Fig. 1b). In this step, the same electrolyte was used, but the anodizing voltage was reduced to 15 V, and the duration was set to 1 min. Previous studies have demonstrated that post-anodizing annealing followed by an additional anodizing step facilitates the uniform detachment of the TiO2 membrane from the Ti substrate [16]. This is because amorphous titania, unlike its crystalline phase, is susceptible to chemical etching agents [17]. Subsequently, the titania nanotubes formed after 20, 30, and 40 min of anodization were coated with Pt by atomic layer deposition for 50 cycles (Fig. 1c). Pt(Me)3(CpMe) (Umicore) and oxygen (99,98%, Air Liquide) were used as organometallic precursor and oxygen source, respectively. Nitrogen (99.99%, Air Liquide) served as a carrier gas. The titania nanotubes on the Ti substrate and three clean silicon wafers (Siegert Wafer B014002), a reference substrate used for Pt layer thickness determination (see details in section 2.2.), were coated with ALD using a hot-wall GEMSTAR-6 Benchtop ALD system (ARRADIANCE, Inc.). Before starting the ALD coating process, the samples were placed in the operating chamber under vacuum until a stable pressure was reached. The chamber, the organometallic precursor, and the manifolds were heated to 270 °C, 70 °C, and 110 °C, respectively. A constant Ar flow of 10 sccm was maintained to keep the baseline pressure at 2.5 × 10−1 Torr. The pulse times for organometallic precursor and oxygen were set to 1500 ms and 500 ms, respectively. The exposure time for each precursor was 45 s, followed by a 60 s purge of the chamber. The thickness of the resulting Pt layers was determined to be 13 nm. The ALD technique is well known for its ability to coat structures with high aspect ratios, ensuring coverage of both the internal and external nanotube walls (as confirmed by SEM and TEM images in subsequent sections) [18,19]. In this case, Pd deposition via ALD was employed to ensure a high fill factor for the titania nanotubes and to provide nucleation sites for subsequent Au electrodeposition. In the next step, the Pt-coated titania nanotubes on the Ti substrate were used as cathodes for the Au electrodeposition process. Au was deposited from a cyanide-based plating solution (Bright Electroless Gold Plating Solution, Sigma-Aldrich). The electrodeposition was carried out in a three-electrode system (Ag/AgCl reference electrode and Pt counter electrode) at room temperature for 3 h at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 [17], using a PlamSense4 potentiostat/galvanostat. This process filled the Pt-seeded nanotubes with Au nanowires and continued until a thin, continuous film completely covered the top of the nanotubes. Two characteristic phases were observed during the Au electrodeposition process, as evidenced by recorded potential changes (Fig. 1f). Initially, Au nanowires formed within the crystalline TiO2 nanopores. Subsequently, a compact thin film developed on the top of the Pt-coated nanotubes (Fig. 1d). The potential profile recorded during deposition (Fig. 1f) shows that the presence of the ALD Pt layer induces an initial potential drop to between −0.72 and −0.78 V versus Ag/AgCl, which gradually decreases over the next 1–2 h, depending on the nanotube length, before stabilizing at a potential similar to direct Au deposition into TNT without Pt (−0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl). This observation indicates that the initial stage involves Au nanowire formation inside the Pt-coated nanotubes, while the steady-state region corresponds to the bulk deposition of flake-like Au structures on the top of nanotubes. A photograph of the TNTM/Pt/AuNW structure, prior to detachment from the Ti substrate, is shown in Fig. 1g. This fabrication strategy results in a large total contact area between the bimetallic nanowire structure and the nanoporous semiconductor. To produce a free-standing TNTM/Pt/AuNW composite (Fig. 1e), the material was subjected to chemical etching in 4 M HCl [21]. The thin amorphous titania layer formed during the post-treatment anodizing step (Fig. 1b) was preferentially etched, leaving the crystalline TNT intact, as confirmed by further morphological analysis. For some samples where the TNTM/Pt/AuNW composite structure was not fully detached from the Ti substrate, gently bending the metal substrate facilitated the detachment process (Fig. 1h). This procedure yielded a stable, self-standing thin layer with a one-side appearing orange (Au) and the other black (representing the bottom of titania nanotubes) (Fig. 1i), with a thin Pt layer in between. 2.2 Materials characterization To evaluate the uniformity of the Pt layer deposited via ALD, reference silicon wafers were analyzed using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) after 50 ALD cycles. Silicon wafers were cut into 1 cm2 pieces and immersed in a piranha solution (¼ H2O2 and ¾ H2SO4) for 20 min to remove organic residues from their surface. Sulfuric acid (98%) and hydrogen peroxide (30%) were obtained from VWR chemicals®. Then, the Si wafers were neutralized with deionized water and subsequently rinsed with DI-water, 2-propanol, ethanol, and DI-water again before being dried using a nitrogen gun. Prior to ALD, the freshly cleaned silicon wafers were measured using SE. The SE data were modeled with SpectraRay-3 software using Cauchy-Stack and Lorentz–Lorenz models for Pt. Three measurements were taken on each silicon wafer, and the average thickness was calculated to determine the Pt layer thickness deposited via ALD. A FEI, QUANTA 3D scanning electron microscope (SEM) in secondary electron mode was used to characterize the morphology of the synthesized materials. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was performed using an EDAX detector. For open-circuit photocatalytic H2 evolution measurements, the samples were prepared as thin films and placed in an oxygen-free aqueous methanol (50 vol%) solution within a quartz tube sealed with septum. The films were illuminated with a 365 nm LED (100 mW cm−2) for 24 h. After 24 h, a 0.2 mL gas aliquot from the headspace of the quartz tube was manually taken through the septum with a 1.0 ml vol. gastight syringe equipped with a PTFE plunger tip and luer lock push-pull shut-off valve, purchased from SGE Analytical Science. The amount of H2 generated was measured using a gas chromatograph (PerkinElmer Clarus 500) equipped with a tandem capillary column (Molsieve 5A/Porabond Q) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD), using argon as a carrier gas. The electrochemical band gap of the material has been established based on the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum. IPCE was defined from photocurrents measured with a photoelectric spectrometer equipped with a 150 W Xenon arc lamp (Instytut Fotonowy, Poland) combined with a potentiostat (Instytut Fotonowy, Poland). Photocurrent vs. time spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 200–600 nm (with a 10 nm wavelength step) at 1.25 V vs. RHE. The IPCE was calculated using the following formula (Eq. (1)): (Eq. 1) I P C E λ % = 1240 W · n m A J p λ A · m − 2 λ n m · P λ W · m − 2 · 100 where J p (λ) is the photocurrent density at the wavelength λ, and P(λ) is the incident power density of light at the given wavelength λ. The material's band gap was determined using the Tauc representation of the spectrum for semiconductors with an indirect band gap, specifically the (IPCE·hυ)0.5 vs. (hυ) plot. The energy value was obtained by identifying the intersection point of the extrapolated linear regions on the plot. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, measurements were performed using a FEI Talos F200S scanning and transmission electron microscope (S/TEM) operated at 200 kV. Lattice fridges were measured from TEM images using ImageJ software. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the crystallographic phase of the analyzed samples. The analysis used a Rigaku ULTIMA IV diffractometer with a CoKα (λ = 1.78897 Å) radiation source, set at 40 mA and 40 kV. Data were acquired in continuous mode over a 2θ range of 25–105°, with a step size of 0.5° and a scan rate of 1° per minute. The acquired data were processed using Match software. The crystallographic phases were identified using the COD database. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in a Teflon cell with a quartz window filled with a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution using a three-electrode configuration. The fabricated samples were used as working electrodes (WEs), a platinum coil as a counter electrode (CE), and an Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl electrode as a reference electrode (RE). EIS spectra were recorded over a frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz with a 5 mV amplitude sinusoidal signal, both in the dark and under UV irradiation (365 nm, 31 mW cm−2, ThorLabs) and recorded with a PalmSense4 potentiostat/galvanostat. The power of the LED has been determined using a power and energy meter (PM100D, ThorLabs).", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "TNTM/Pt/AuNW", "Syns_method": "multi-step anodizing/ALD/electrodeposition", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {}, "solvents": {}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "450 °C", "time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "etch", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "HCl", "amount": "4 M"}]}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "ALD Pt", "parameters": {"temperature": "270 °C", "cycles": "50"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "electrodeposition Au", "parameters": {"current density": "1 mA cm−2", "time": "3 h", "voltage": "-0.72 to -0.78 V vs Ag/AgCl"}}}}}}}

The solvothermal process is one of the most used methods of MOF synthesis due to its simplicity and processability. In this method, metal salt is mixed with the solution of organic ligands in a proper solvent. The synthesis is called hydrothermal when water is used as a solvent. After stirring the precursor solution, it is placed and closed in a Teflon-lined steel vessel at temperatures from 120 to 220 °C. This method commonly synthesizes MOF series such as UiOs [43], MILs [44], and ZIFs [45]. Hydrothermal synthesis under normal pressure is considered on an industrial scale because it is a simple and undemanding method that does not require mechanical or thermal energy input, leading to a smaller final cost of the material [46,47]. Microwave-assisted synthesis follows the same steps as solvothermal synthesis, except the mixture is heated by microwave instead of a conventional oven. Some typical MOFs can be synthesized using the this method, such as, UiO-66, ZIF-67 and HKUST-1 [48]. Microwave-assisted synthesis permits the uniform and rapid heating of the mixture, which means homogeneous nucleation and well-defined size distribution [44,49]. The main advantage of this method over the solvothermal synthesis is the reaction time up to 1 hour compared to 24 hours in the solvothermal technique. Electrochemical synthesis uses the principle of electrolysis and involves two electrodes, galvanic cells, and a reactor. When oxidizing voltage or current is applied, the electrode (anode) starts to dissolve in a solution containing a supporting electrolyte and an organic linker. As the electrode dissolves, metal ions are quickly released near its surface. These metal ions then react with the organic ligands in the solution, leading to the formation of a MOF layer on the surface of the electrode. Electrochemical synthesis is used for applications requiring thin layers of MOFs, like sensors and electronic devices. HKUST-1, ZIF-8, UiO-66 and NU-1000 can be prepared by electrochemical synthesis [50]. Although electrochemical synthesis is not as popular as solvothermal and microwave methods, it has some important advantages: the synthesis is fast under mild conditions (ambient temperature and pressure), the anions are removed from metal salts, and the solution consists of metallic ions and organic linkers, which increases the reaction yield. The electric potential is precisely controlled, allowing its scaling up [41–43]. The sonochemical or ultrasound-assisted method is based on the effect of acoustic cavitation, which involves sequential generation, growth, and collapse of bubbles in a so-called hot spot. This process leads to high local heating and high pressures, accumulating an amount of energy sufficient to accomplish the reaction of MOF synthesis. Popular MOFs, like MIL-53, MOF-5 and HKUST-1 can be synthesized sonochemicaly [51]. This method permits the obtaining of smaller particle sizes at milder conditions, facilitates the narrow size contribution of particles, increases the purity of particles, and shortens the reaction time [41,45,52]. Mechanochemical synthesis is achieved by simple ball milling or manual grinding of the reagents. During the grinding, the initial chemical bonds are broken, exposing reactive layers of atoms for chemical reaction and new bond formation. The main advantage of this method is the possibility of using safer, environmentally friendly reagents, like metal oxides, instead of metal salts [53,54]. The well-known MOFs, including MOF-5, MIL-101, ZIF-8, HKUST-1, and UiO-66, can be synthesized using the mechanochemical approach [55]. Sol-gel synthesis is a technique of generating a colloidal suspension of precursors within a solvent, followed by the formation of a gel upon the addition of a catalyst. The resulting material consists of a solid backbone that encloses the liquid phase. Further, the solvent phase is removed by evaporation, affording highly porous structures that are inaccessible via previously described methods. The sol-gel method allows the formation of different pore size regimes within the same material [56,57]. 2.2 Structure and stability The structure and properties of MOFs are controlled by the nature of metallic cations, the nature and geometry of organic units (linkers/ligands), and conditions of synthesis, such as concentration and ratio of precursors, temperature, pressure, time of synthesis, and solvents. An unlimited number of materials with the requested size and topology are designed by changing metal ions and organic linkers. The inorganic part of MOF is represented by metallic ion of transition, rare earth metal, or 3p-element of various charges (2+, 3+, 4+, etc.). Organic linkers include carboxylates [58–63], azolates (imidazolates, pyrazolates, triazolates, etc.) [64–66], phosphonates [67–69], etc. Functional MOFs, metal nodes, and organic linkers are designed from organic ligands with functional groups, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a). Organic functional groups are classified in two categories depending on their role and position in the framework, i.e., coordinating sites and guest-interactive sites (Fig. 4(b)) [70]. Coordinating functional groups coordinate with metal ions during the construction of MOF and often include functions such as carboxylate, sulfonate, phosphonate, and heterocyclic compounds. On the other hand, guest-interactive sites remain intact during the self-assembly of MOF and are free to interact with guest molecules. Like coordinating groups, the second class includes carboxylate, sulfonate, phosphonate, urea, amide, oxalamide, imide, and triazine, which are only applied as guest-interactive sites. The stability of MOF is its property in maintaining its structure and coordination bonds under thermal and chemical conditions [71,72]. Most MOFs are thermally stable until 350−400 °C and selected ones are stable above 500 °C (MOF-5, UiO-66, MIL-53) [19,73]. The increase of rigidity of organic linker leads to an increase in MOF’s rigidity, and results in a higher thermal and chemical stability of MOFs [74–76]. Many MOFs degrade in water due to hydrolysis, making them difficult to use for adsorption in aqueous solutions [19,71,77]. The force of the coordination bond is one of the most important parameters assuring the stability of MOF, and it depends on the couple of Lewis acids and bases composing the structure of the framework [19]. The coordination bonds between a strong acid and a strong base, or weak acid and a weak base, are the strongest. Therefore, metal ions of greater valency, such as Cr3+, Zr4+, or Ti4+, are preferred to create bonds with strong carboxylic acid, and the metal ions of weaker valency, such as Cu2+ or Zn2+, create bonds with weak base ligands, such as imidazolates [21]. 2.3 Functionalization of organic linkers Isoreticular (having the same topology) chemistry within MOFs is one of the promising solutions for the selective adsorption of analytes. Functionalization of organic linkers can be used for different purposes; one is to increase the pore size of MOF. Functional groups presented in the main chain can be widely varied. Structures isoreticular to MOF-5 and MOF-74 are obtained by replacing BDC with other ditopic carboxylate linkers, as shown in Fig. 5. Linker size change extends MOF's pore size from 0.38 to 2.88 nm for MOF-5 and from 1.4 to 9.8 nm for MOF-74 [78–80]. Another reason for the functionalization of organic linkers is the appropriation of physico-chemical attraction properties to adsorbent. For that, functional groups in the side chain of the organic linker can be changed depending on the properties of the adsorbate. The most common example is the use of amino-containing side chain, apporting basic properties to MOF ( Fig. 6) [81]. NH2-BDC-based MOF have a more negative zeta potential, which causes a higher removal rate of cationic dyes. Dye-MOF interactions are discussed in detail further. 2.4 Defect engineering Defects in MOFs are defined as sites of local disruption of the regular arrangement of atoms or ions in the framework caused by missing organic linkers or metallic ions. Defect engineering is considered an effective method for increased porosity and surface area of MOF and is based on (1) the use of modulators or (2) post-synthetic treatment [82]. The interest of post-synthetic treatment is the possibility of introducing a greater range of functionalities to MOFs because it is not restricted by the solvothermal synthesis conditions of parent MOF. However, post-synthetic treatment is commonly used in gas separation (CO2, N2, H2) [83], and less in dye removal. Modulators such as formic, acetic, and trifluoroacetic acids change porosity through cluster defects [84,85]. Modulators form competitive relationships with ligands to play the role of coordination modulation, breaking the coordination balance in the crystal growth process. Modulators compete with organic linkers for the metal coordination site, creating voids (defects) in the original structure of MOF. The defect modulation of MOFs is influenced by the synthesis conditions, synthesis temperature, the acidity and concentration of the modulator, and the ratio of the modulator to the ligand. Tan et al. studied the impact of the ratio of hydrofluoric acid as a modulator in iron-based MIL-100 on the adsorption of methylene blue [86]. The modulator increase led to a remarkable increase in the Langmuir surface and pore volume. As a result, the adsorption of MB was more effective on the MIL-100, which had the highest amount of modulator among those studied. The smaller particles of MIL-100(Fe)-4–0F in the first hour of an experiment performed a two times faster sorption rate than larger particles of MIL-100(Fe)-4–3F ( Fig. 7). The type of modulator used in a modified synthesis influences the sorption ability of the obtained adsorbent. In the study of Vo et al., toluene was adsorbed on a series of UiO-67(Zr) with different modulators [85]. Formic (Fo), acetic (Ac), and propionic (Pro) acids were used as defect modulators. The authors showed that the toluene adsorption occurred more readily on the MOF modulated with formic acid. The adsorption capacity of Fo-modulated MOF was 11 % and 16 % higher than that of Ac-modulated and Pro-modified MOF, respectively. Besides, higher formate concentrations in the solution favored the competition between formic acid and organic linker, which resulted in a more porous MOF. 2.5 Carbonization Carbonization is another strategy that allows the synthesis of a porous framework by changing the physio-chemical properties of the initial one, especially by the evaporation of metals or complete MOF. Liu et al. used MOFs as templates for porous carbon synthesis [87]. MOF-5, used as a template, was heated at 150°C in the atmosphere of furfuryl alcohol used as carbon precursor and polymerized in the pores of MOF-5 during the reaction. During the carbonization process, the MOF-5 framework decomposes, behaving as a self-sacrificed template and resulting in the formation of the nanoporous carbon (NPC). The increase of carbonization temperature from 800 to 1000 °C increases the pore volume more than three times, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area by almost seven times. Carbonization can be used to change the charge of MOF. In the study of Abbasi et al., the Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8) was carbonized to result in negatively charged NPC [88]. The carbonization of ZIF-8 increased its adsorption capacity towards cationic MB dye by ten times, compared to the non-carbonized ZIF-8.", "output": {}}

For comparison, Co-CNFs and bare CNFs were prepared using similar processes. The detailed synthesis procedure is as follows: First, 0.4 g cobalt (II) acetate anhydrous (Co(AC)2) and 0.8 g polyacrylonitrile (PAN) were mixed in 10 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). After 12 h of continuous stirring, a red precursor with a high viscosity was obtained. Then, the as-prepared liquid precursor was loaded into a plastic syringe for spinning. A piece of 30 × 40 cm clean aluminum foil was used as the collector during spinning. The applied voltage was controlled at 10.0 kV. At the end of the spinning process, the obtained fibers on the aluminum foil were transferred to an oven at 80 °C for drying for more than 12 h. Subsequently, the dried fibers were first annealed in air at 300 °C for 5 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then the fibers were further annealed in an Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 5 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to form Co-CNFs (Co nanoparticles inlaid in carbon nanofibers). Finally, the Co-CNFs were transferred into H-Co3O4-CNFs after heating in air at 300 °C for 5 h. The H-Co3O4-CNFs catalysts prepared with 0.4, 0.2, and 0.6 g Co(AC)2 reagent were denoted as H-Co3O4-CNFs (or H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.4), H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.2, H-Co3O4-CNFs-0.6, respectively. 2.2 Characterization The morphology and structure of the catalyst samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI NANO430 and Regulus SU8100) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, Cu Kα = 0.15406 nm). More specific structural details were obtained using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F). Analysis of the material composition depends on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which was carried out on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using monochromated Al Kα radiation. Raman spectra were obtained using a LabRam Aramis Raman system (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with a 632.8 nm laser as the excitation source. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted using a NETZSCH STA44C instrument. The operation was performed from 25 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the catalyst samples were measured using a surface area and pore size analyzer (ASAP 2460) under a nitrogen atmosphere (adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K). 2.3 Electrochemical tests The electrocatalytic performances of all samples were investigated using a standard three-electrode cell, in which a graphite rod and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were employed as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared as follows: A catalyst ink was prepared by adding 4.9 mg of catalyst powder to a solution made of 990 µL ethanol and 10 µL 5% Nafion solution. After 10 min of sonication, 18 µL of the as-prepared ink was deposited on a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) with a disk area of 0.196 cm2 and a ring area of 0.237 cm2. The total mass loading was calculated to be approximately 0.45 mg cm−2. To extract the kinetic parameters of ORR on catalysts, the kinetic parameter (transferred electron number) can be further calculated based on the disk current and ring current using the following equation [3]: n = 4I d/(I d + I r/N), where I d is the disk current, I r is the ring current, and N is the collection efficiency. 2.4 Li-O2 cells assembly and characterization The oxygen cathode was fabricated by soaking nickel foam in a homogeneous catalyst slurry and then drying at 80 °C for 12 h. Generally, a homogeneous slurry was prepared by mixing 60 wt% of catalyst, 30 wt% of Ketjenblack carbon (KB), and 10 wt% of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in an N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution. The mass loading of the slurry on the electrode was approximately 0.5 mg cm−2. All coin cells (porous 2032 coin cells) were assembled in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere. Glass fiber (Whatman®) membranes and Li foil were used as the separator and anode, respectively. LiTFSI (1.0 mol/L) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) electrolyte was employed as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic discharge-charge tests were carried out with a Battery Testing System (Neware) between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on the electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6ex) at a potential range from 2.0 to 4.5 V (vs. Li+/Li) at 0.2 mV s−1.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental\nThe A356 alloy and in-situ TiB2 were selected as the matrix and particulate reinforcement, respectively. The in-situ TiB2 particles were synthesized via flux-assisted synthesis using potassium hexafluoro-titanate (K2TiF6) and potassium tetrafluoroborate (KBF4) salts (procured from Sigma Aldrich). These salts were mixed with molten A356 in different ratios for the formation of respective concentrations of TiB2 in the alloy. Initially, 1.2 kg of A356 alloy was melted at 800 °C in an electrical resistance furnace. The quantified K2TiF6 and KBF4 salts were mixed at a stoichiometric ratio and preheated at 200 °C for 1 hour before being added to the molten alloy.\nThe preheated salts were added to the melt, maintained at 800°C, and stirred continuously using an impeller at 300 rpm for 1 h. Afterward, the prepared melt was held for another 1 h to ensure complete reaction. Once the reaction was complete, the slag was removed, and the melt underwent high-shear mixing at a temperature of 750 °C, as shown in Figure 1. The high-shear mixing device (supplied by Dasmet Pvt. Ltd., Raipur) operates on a pressure difference mechanism. It consists of a rotor fixed to the motor shaft within a stator unit that has 2 mm diameter holes along a certain height. After holding the melt for 10 min, the preheated rotor-stator mixer was dipped into the melt and rotated at 4000 rpm for 15 min. This high-speed rotation created a low-pressure region at the bottom of the crucible, causing the melt to flow from the bottom to the top. The melt was forced through the stator’s 2 mm holes, generating intense shearing action. This shearing effectively breaks down particle agglomerates, refining them for uniform dispersion. The schematic presentations of impeller mixing and HSM processes are shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 1\nHigh shear mixing technique device.\nFull size image\nFigure 2\nSchematic of (a) Impeller mixing and (b) High shear mixing technique.\nFull size image\nThe prepared composite melt was then poured into the ceramic-coated (zirconium dioxide) steel hollow cylindrical mold (Figure 3a) (preheated at 400 °C) and spun at 1500 rpm using a vertical centrifugal machine until solidification to produce a disc with dimensions of 75 mm inner diameter, 150 mm outer diameter and 20 mm height (~ 1 Kg of metal) as shown in Figure 3b.\nFigure 3\n(a) Vertical centrifugal casting mould and schematic (b) A356-xTiB2 nanocomposite brake disc.\nFull size image\nTable 1 shows the chemical composition of the A356 alloy and the A356-x TiB2 nanocomposites, as obtained by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) analysis (average of 5 tests). The prepared composite discs were sectioned at different locations and polished using standard methods for metallographic examinations. Keller’s etchant (95% H2O + 2.5% HNO3 + 1.5% HCl + 1% HF) was used for the microstructural examination. The microstructures of etched samples were observed under an inverted optical microscope (Zeiss Axio vert. A1) equipped with Image analysis software and a scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova Nano SEM 450). The size and distribution of particle agglomerates and eutectic Si length were analyzed quantitatively from the optical microstructures (5 images) taken from different parts of the disc using Image J software. Different phases in the cast composites were identified using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (k = 1.54 A˚), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with a scan rate of 0.01/s. Elemental distribution within the composites was mapped using Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with EDS mapping. The presence of nano TiB2 particles in the composites was confirmed through Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis (Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN (FEI)). Tensile tests were conducted on flat specimens (35 mm gauge length, 4 mm width, 4 mm thickness, 69 mm total length) using an Instron machine 5967 with 30 KN load cell at a strain rate of 0.5 mm/min, with three specimens tested. Compression testing was conducted on at least two different cylindrical samples of dimensions (4 mm x 6 mm) on the same Instron machine at a strain rate of 0.5 mm/min. Fracture analysis of the tested samples was carried out using SEM. Brinell hardness was measured at different positions of the disc using a load of 62.5 kg (ball diameter = 2.5 mm) and a dwell time of 15 s, and an average of the reading was considered.\nTable 1 Chemical Composition of A356 Alloy and A356-xTiB2 Composite Samples\nFull size table\nA dry sliding wear test of the prepared alloy and composites (ø5 mm × 15 mm) was carried out using a pin-on-disc instrument (DUCOM, TR50).

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods 2.1 Material preparation The fabrication of nano TiB-reinforced TMCs involves three steps. First, spherical Ti–TiB composite powders (approximately 3.29 wt% of TiB) with a particle size distribution of ∼125 μm were prepared using the EIGA technique. The key parameters for the EIGA process included an atomization pressure of 4–4.5 MPa, a power of 28–32 kW, and a feeding rate of 40 mm/min. Detailed preparation procedures are provided in our previous work [16,21–23]. Next, these spherical Ti–TiB composite powders were consolidated into cylindrical billets (30 mm in diameter, 40 mm height) using SPS. Sintering was conducted a pressure of 30 MPa and a vacuum of 5 Pa for 30 min at 800 °C to produce the as-sintered billets. For comparison, additional billets were prepared at 1000 °C and 1200 °C under the same conditions. Finally, these billets were hot extruded to achieve full densification. Prior to hot extrusion, they were preheated to 800 °C for 10 min under an argon atmosphere. The billets were then extruded through a 10 mm inner diameter die using a hydraulic press (SHP-200-450, Shibayama), with an extrusion ratio 9:1 and a ram speed of 6 mm/s. The samples prepared at 800 °C, 1000 °C, and 1200 °C are referred to as TMC800, TMC1000, and TMC1200, respectively. 2.2 Microstructural characterization The phase identification of the spherical Ti–TiB composite powders was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, XRD-6100, SHIMAZU) at room temperature. The microstructure and fracture morphology of both the spherical Ti–TiB composite powders and the as-prepared Ti–TiB composites were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL). To examine the TiB distribution within the composite powders, a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL) was used. For grain size, texture, and phase analysis, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was employed using a TSL system (TSL, DigiView IV; EDAX) attached to a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The electron beam scanned the sample in 0.5 μm steps. Both the longitudinal cross-sections of the extruded samples and the Ti–TiB composite powders were first mechanically ground with 5 μm silicon-carbide paper. For the as-prepared Ti–TiB composites, the samples were then electrochemically polished with an electron-polishing solution (95 % CH3COOH/5 % HClO4) at a voltage of 50 V for 10 s. The Ti–TiB composite powders were vibratory polished in a nano SiO2 suspension for 8 h. A simultaneous oxygen/hydrogen/nitrogen analyzer (EMGA-830 OK; HORIBA) was employed to measure the oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen content in both the spherical Ti–TiB composite powders and the extruded rods. 2.3 Mechanical testing Tensile samples were prepared by cutting the extruded rods into specimens with a gauge diameter of 3 mm and a length of 15 mm. Tensile testing was performed using a universal testing machine (AG-X 50 kN, Shimadzu) at a strain rate of 5 × 10−4 S−1, with strain measurements recorded via a CCD camera.

As the catalytic reaction proceeds, the fluorescence color changes significantly from green to orange-red due to the different interaction mechanisms between the electron-deficient PFOA and smaller radius F− with the ratiometric fluorescent probe MOF-76 (Tb: Eu = 29:1). The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 0.0127 mM for PFOA and 0.00746 mM for F−. In addition, the conversion rate of the catalytic reaction can be read directly based on the chromaticity value by establishing a three-dimensional relationship graph of G/R value-conversion rate-time (G/R indicates the ratio between green and red luminance values in the image.), allowing for real-time and rapid tracking of the PFOA degradation. The recoveries of PFOA and F− in the actual water samples were 99.3–102.7% (RSD = 2.2–4.4%) and 100.7–105.3% (RSD = 3.9–6.8%), respectively. Both theoretical calculations and experiments reveal that the detection mechanism was attributed to the photoinduced electron transfer and energy transfer between the analytes and the probe. This method simplifies the sample analysis process and avoids the use of bulky instruments, and thus has great potential on the design and development of quantitative time-resolved visualization methods to assess catalytic performance and reveal mechanisms.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "MOF-76 (Tb: Eu = 29:1)", "application": "luminescent probe for real-time evaluation of PFOA photocatalytic degradation", "props": {"limit_of_detection_PFOA": "0.0127 mM", "limit_of_detection_F-": "0.00746 mM"}}}}

Mechanical shaking of samples was performed on a vortex mixer (WiseMix VM-10; Daihan Wisd, Korea). The NPs were homogeneously dispersed by a Wisd Wise Clean sonicator (WISD instruments, Korea) through ultrasonic process. pH was measured with an inoLab pH 730 pH meter (WTW, Germany).

After ultrasonication, the model solutions were centrifuged for 8 min at 4000 rpm for phase separation. The nanosorbents collected in the bottom of the centrifuge tubes were separated from the aqueous phase through decantation. 2.5 mL of 2 M HCL solution was added to the sorbent to elute the analyte ions retained on the sorbent.

The thermal behavior of the nanocomposite films was investigated using DSC and TGA. The experimental results indicate that the glass transition temperatures of the nanocomposites increased by increasing the added amount of TiO2 NPs to be 53.7 °C (1 wt.%), 55.8 °C (3 wt.%), and 60.6 °C (5 wt.%), which were consistently lower than the glass transition temperature of the matrix material (69.6 °C).

All data revealed that the Ag/TiO2/graphene nanocomposite showed a rich cell structure. The photocatalytic activity of Ag/TiO2/graphene nanocomposite is higher than those of pristine TiO2 nanosheets and TiO2/graphene nanocomposite. Under optimized conditions, the degradation efficiency was 100% and 71% for MB (30 mg/L) and with 10 mg Ag/TiO2/graphene nanocomposite under UV and visible light irradiation for 2 h, respectively. Ag/TiO2/graphene also showed excellent bacteria-killing activity. Meanwhile, the Ag/TiO2/graphene nanocomposite exhibited microstructure stability and cyclic stability. The water treatment performance was enhanced mainly attributed to the excellent adsorption performance of graphene and the high efficiency in separation of electron–hole pairs induced by the remarkable synergistic effects of TiO2, Ag, and graphene. On the basis of the experimental results, the photocatalytic mechanism and MB degradation mechanism were proposed.

Nano-CaCO3 was provided by Qianhai JYSA Technology Co., Ltd. 0.8 M LiPF6 in trimethyl phosphate (TMP)/10 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP), LiFePO4, LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2, graphite, super P and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) was supplied from Canrd New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (v:v:v = 1:1:1) was purchased from Songjing New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. Polypropylene (PP) separator (Celgard 2500) was used as a control. 2.2 Preparation of CPVH membrane 0.8 g PVDF-HFP was dissolved in 8 g NMP, then 1.2 g CaCO3 (60/40, w/w, CaCO3/PVDF-HFP) was added and bath sonicated for 1 h to prepare a uniform and white slurry. CPVH membranes used throughout this study were prepared by doctor blading on smooth glass using a scraper with 400 μm height. The membranes were dried quickly in oven at 80 °C, then vacuumed at 80 °C overnight. CPVH was activated by 0.8 M LiPF6 in TMP/10 vol% FEC to prepare CPVH-NE. 2.3 Characterization The morphologies characterizations were carried out on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7500F) at 15 kV. All samples were sprayed with gold before test. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was applied to show the element distribution mapping. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on an X‘Pert Pro MPD diffractometer (Cu Kα) and scattering angle (2θ) range of 10°–60°. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was carried out under N2 flowing at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a NETZSCH TG 209 F1. Thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) curves were acquired using HITACHI TG/DTA 7200 simultaneous thermal analyzer. Tensile properties of membranes were performed by universal tensile testing machine (CMT4104, Shenzhen SANS Testing Machine Co., Ltd) at a crosshead speed of 5 mm min−1. The thickness was measured by micrometer caliper. Each sample was tested five times. Nitrogen gas adsorption and desorption isotherms were recorded with an BELSORP MAX Ⅱ instrument (Microtrac MRB, Japan). The specific surface area was calculated according to the BET method using the adsorption data, whereas the pore size distribution was determined using the BJH method. Contact angle measurements were performed using a JC2000D2H goniometer. Contact angles were measured using 5 μL electrolyte droplets.The liquid electrolyte uptake and retention were calculated according to the equation (1) and (2): (1) Electrolyteuptake = W t - W 0 W 0 × 100 % (2) Electrolyteretention = W x - W 0 W t - W 0 × 100 % where W0 represents the weight of the pristine membrane, Wt represents the weight of the liquid electrolyte-saturated membrane, and Wx is the equilibrium weight of the wet membrane at specific time. A microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC, Govmark) was used to evaluate the combustion behaviors of CPVH and PP separator. Samples with about 5 mg were heated to 700 °C in a stream of nitrogen flowing at 80 cm3/min at a constant heating rate 1 °C s−1. The thermal decomposition products in the nitrogen gas stream were mixed with 20 mL/min stream of 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen and then burned in the combustion furnace at 900 °C. Solution NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz Avance III spectrometer by using acetone‑d 6 solvent. The surface compositions of the Li-metal were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) using a standard Al Kα X-ray source. Samples were fixed using double-sided adhesive tape, and binding energies are referenced to the C1s binding energy of adventitious carbon contamination taken to be 284.8 eV. The DSC of the LIB coin cells was carried out with a Netzsch MMC 274 Nexus including the coin cell module. The weight of samples comprises Li anode, LiFePO4 cathode, electrolyte and separator. The heat released per weight was calculated by heat peak area. The assembled cells were fully charged to 4.2 V (state of charge, SOC = 100%) before testing. The cells were measured at a constant temperature increase rate of 1 °C min−1 from 40 to 300 °C. Ionic conductivity was got by a CHI 760E electrochemical station from 1 Hz to 100 kHz. The membrane disk (19 mm in diameter) was sandwiched between two stainless steels and then assembled in a CR2032 coin cell. The ionic conductivity was calculated from the following equation (3): (3) σ = l S R where l is the thickness of the membrane, R is the resistance, and S is the area of the stainless steel. The electrochemical stability window was obtained by linear sweep voltammetry. A stainless steel will be an electrode and a lithium metal will be a counter electrode. The voltage was swept between 0 V and 6 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The chronoamperometry profiles were obtained by using an electrochemical working station (Princeton ParSTAT) with a polarization voltage of 10 mV. The AC impedance plots before and after polarization were measured in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz-100000 Hz. The lithium ion transference number can be obtained by the following equation (4): (4) t L i + = I s Δ V - I 0 R 0 I 0 Δ V - I s R s where Δ V is 10 mV, I0 and Is are the initial current and the steady state current, R0 and Rs are the interfacial resistance before and after polarization for 1000 s, respectively. CV test was performed on SS/electrolyte/Li cells between –0.5 and 1 V with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the LiFePO4/Li batteries was recorded from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. Cycling performance and rate capability tests of batteries were measured by battery test system (Shenzhen Neware Electronics Co., Ltd). The voltage ranges of LiFePO4/Li, LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2/Li and graphite/Li batteries are 2.5–4.2 V, 3.0–4.3 V, 0.01–2 V, respectively. The electrodes were prepared by conventional slurry-coating method. The active material (LiFePO4 or LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 or graphite), acetylene black and PVDF were mixed with a weight ratio of 8:1:1. The active material weight is around 1.6 mg cm−2. The weight of Li anode is 45.9 mg (15.6 mm in diameter and 0.45 mm in thickness). To measure high-temperature performance of batteries, commercial LiFePO4 cathodes and graphite anodes were used to assemble full cells. Typical active loadings of LiFePO4 and graphite electrodes were 11.5 and 5.8 mg cm−2, respectively. 1 M Lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB) in 1/1 EC/PC + 5%VC was used as the working electrolyte for high-temperature measurements. LiFePO4/graphite full-cells were cycled between 2.4 and 3.7 V with a rate of 2C at 120 °C.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "CPVH", "Syns_method": "doctor blading", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "PVDF-HFP", "amount": "0.8 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "CaCO3", "amount": "1.2 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C4H9NO", "amount": "8 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "sonicate", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "doctor blade", "parameters": {"scraper height": "400 μm"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "quick"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "vacuum", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "overnight"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "activate", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "0.8 M LiPF6 in TMP/10 vol% FEC"}]}}}}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods 2.1 Preparation of Si/GNs composites The synthesis of Si/GNs composite was illustrated in Fig. 1 . Commercial SiO2 (∽20 nm particle size, 99.5% trace metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich), Mg powder (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and GNs at molar ratios of 1:2.5:12, 4:10:12, 6:15:12 were placed in a hardened steel container with agate balls (Φ = 0.8 cm) at a ball-to-powder ratio of 20:1 and ball-milled at 1000 rpm for 8 h under an argon gas atmosphere. Particle sizes of commercial SiO2 and Mg powders were approximately 20 nm and 3 μm, respectively. The three mixtures were spread evenly in corundum boats to avoid local heat accumulation during the exothermic reaction. The corundum boats were heated inside a tube furnace under argon gas flow to 400 °C over 10 min, then they were heated to 650 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min, and finally they were held at 650 °C for 2 h, followed by cooling to room temperature. The three heated samples were then soaked in 1 M HCl solution for 6 h to remove MgO and Mg2Si and then they were soaked in 5% hydrofluoric acid for 0.5 h to ensure that any unreacted or newly formed SiO2 was removed. The resulted products were filtered, washed and dried at 100 °C to obtain Si/GNs composites. The Si/GNs composites were named Si/GNs-0.08, Si/GNs-0.33, and Si/GNs-0.50 according to the molar ratio of SiO2 and GNs in reactants. 2.2 Material characterizations The X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rint-2000, Rigaku) and TOPAS software were applied to examine the phase structure of the Si/GNs composite using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with an operating voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. The Raman spectra were measured using a Renishaw Raman spectroscope (RE01) with a 514 nm excitation argon laser. The surface morphologies of GNs, and the Si/GNs composite were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI, Quanta 250). The transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100 HT) was used to analyze the internal morphology of the Si/GNs composite. 2.3 First-principles DFT calculations All calculations in this work were carried out by plane-wave DFT code CASTEP [27] with the GGA PBE functional [28] and Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotential [29]. TS van der Waals correction schemes [30] were applied in calculation involving graphite. The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon (BFGS) algorithm [31] was adopted to optimize the atomic positions until the convergence criteria met 2.0 × 10−5 eV/atom for maximum energy total energy change, 0.05 eV/Å for maximum force, 0.1 GPa for maximum stress, and 0.002 Å for the maximum displacement, respectively. A kinetic energy cut-off in the plane-wave basis was set as 420 eV. The k-point meshes were set at 4 × 4 × 3 for the Graphite unit cell, and 9 × 9 × 9 for the Si and SiC bulk unit cell using Monkhorst-Pack scheme [32]. The k-point mesh of Si and SiC surface slabs were set at 9 × 9 × 1. The k-space sampling was restricted to the Γ-point considering the huge number of atoms (over 250) involved in the interface slabs. For Si and SiC surface slab, a vacuum thickness of 12 Å was employed on the both sides. A 14 Å vacuum region was employed for three interface supercells of Si(111)/graphite(001), Si(111)/SiC(111), and SiC(111)/graphite(001). Methods for surface energies (γ) and ideal work of adhesion (Wad ) were provided in Supplementary Information. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The working electrode was prepared by casting a slurry containing Si/GNs composite (70 wt%), carbon black (20 wt%) and polyacrylic acid (Mw = 100,000, 10 wt%) on Cu foils, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The CR2025 coin-type cells were constructed in a glove box using Li foil or commercial LiFePO4 as the counter electrode, and a Cellgard 2400 microporous membrane as the separator. 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1, in volume) was used as the electrolyte. In half cells, the Si electrode area was 0.785 cm2; the mass loading of Si/GNs was either ~1.35 mg cm−2 (low loading) or ~2.97 mg cm−2 (high loading). In full cells, the Si/GNs anode mass loading was ~0.36 mg cm−2 and LiFePO4 cathode mass loading was ~3.60 mg cm−2. The N/P ratio of full cell is 0.90. The density of Si/GNs-0.33 electrode and LiFePO4 electrode is 0.85 g cm−3 and 2.40 g cm−3. The porosity of our Si/GNs-0.33 electrode and LiFePO4 electrode is 61.6% and 21.0%. The swelling of our Si/GNs-0.33 electrode and LiFePO4 electrode is 19.3% and 29.0%. The electrolyte used in high-loading half cell and full cells contains 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate additive. The galvanostatic cycling of half cells and full cells was performed on a battery tester (BT2000, Arbin, USA) in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V and 2.0–4.0 V, respectively. The specific capacity is calculated based on the total mass of Si/GNs.

Applications of MOFs in PDT are described using examples of several combination therapy innovations developed for the purpose of solving some of the key challenges in the clinical translation value chain of PDT. The review presents evidence to show that the explosion of research in MOFs is due to their capability for applications as carriers and delivery systems for PDT photosensitizers. It also shows their unique applications as platforms for combination therapies, for stimulus responsive release of photosensitizer and drug molecules, for cancer cell targeting, and for auxiliary enhancement of efficacy. Published literature on MOFs has been on the rise since the eighties. In Scopus, the applications of MOFs in PDT increased from 1 article in 2010, to 169 articles in 2023, whereas published literature on MOFs generally, increased from 878 to 11644 during this period. Research on the applications of MOFs in PDT has therefore increased more than that of MOFs generally.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "The use of supported metal-based heterogeneous catalysts is very ubiquitous in the modern chemical industry. Although high reactivity has been achieved, conventional supported metal-based heterogeneous catalysts commonly face the problem of rapid deactivation, generally involving leaching, poisoning or sintering of the active metal species, which is particularly serious in various solid acid catalysis processes. To overcome these drawbacks, different strategies have been adopted, including strengthening metal–support interactions, confining metal species in various porous materials, or coating the active metal nanoparticles with thin shells, which may generate effective metal-based nanocomposite catalysts with enhanced stability. In this feature article, we summarize our recent work on the design of some metal-based nanocomposites possessing yolk–shell, core–shell or other confined structures for enhanced catalytic applications in several important acid catalysis reactions, such as cycloaddition of CO2, epoxidation of olefins, acylation of aromatic compounds, and transesterification/carbonylation synthesis of organic carbonates. More attention is paid to the design and preparation strategy of metal-based nanocomposite catalysts, which can generate unique catalytically active and stable metal sites for meeting the tough requirements of a specific catalytic reaction. Finally, the existing challenges and the future directions for metal-based nanocomposite catalysts with respect to the preparation strategies and catalytic application prospects are proposed.", "output": {}}

The 4,4′,4″-tricarboxyltriphenylamine (H3TCA) and 4,4′-(9,10-anthracenediyl) bis-Pyridine (BPPB) ligands used in the synthesis of DZU-115 and −116 crystals were purchased from Jilin Chinese Academy of Sciences-Yanshen Technology Co. Acetone (AC), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), ethylacetate (EA), methanol (MeOH), N,N-Diethylformamide (DEF), N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the two complexes obtained were collected on a Bruker D8A A25-XRD ray diffractometer with a setting of 2θ ranging from 5° to 50°. Thermogravimetric characterization was performed on both the synthesized and activated samples. The activated samples were washed several times with DMA solvent and acetone solvent and heated in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 6 h. After the instrument was preheated, 5–10 mg of the treated samples were added to the crucible, the crucible was slowly placed on the stand with the crucible lid closed, and the sample loading port of the thermogravimeter was closed. The temperature was set from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1, and the experiment was conducted under nitrogen atmosphere. The thermal stability of the two complexes was analyzed according to the thermogravimetric curves obtained from the experiments. The IR data of the crystals were collected on a Shimadzu FTIR-8400S spectrometer. A small number of crystals were added to KBr crystal powder, ground for 5 min, and the powder was pressed into the infrared spectrometer for data acquisition in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. 2.2 Synthesis of {[Zn2(TCA)(BPPB)(DMA)(OH)]·2DMA}n (DZU-115), [Zn(HTCA)(BPPB)0.5(DMA)]n (DZU-116) Solvent plays a crucial role in regulating the structure of MOF. The selection and usage method of solvent can have a significant impact on crystal structure, pore morphology, surface properties, and other factors. Therefore, it is essential to identify an appropriate solvent and optimize its ratio and other conditions to achieve the desired modulation effect [40,41]. In this study, acetonitrile solvent was employed to induce crystal structures, leading to the synthesis of two MOFs based on the same mixed ligands. For the synthesis of DZU-115, H3TCA (4 mg), BPPB (4 mg) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (10 mg) were ultrasonically dissolved in 2.1 mL mixed solutions of DMA/H2O(v:v = 20:1), and then sealed in a 4 mL heat-resistant glass vial. The mixture was heated at 90 °C for 24 h until light yellow crystals formed. After cooling, the crystals were collected by filtration, washed with fresh DMA and acetone solvents three times, and finally air-dried at room temperature to obtain clean crystal samples (Fig. 1 a). DZU-116 was prepared similarly to DZU-115 except that 1 mL of acetonitrile solvent was added to the mixed solution. Light yellow crystals were generated, collected, and then rinsed with DMA solvent before being air-dried at room temperature (Fig. 1b). 2.3 Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis The crystals used for collecting single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were synthesized using the above-described method. The crystals with good growth conditions and few cracks were selected under a microscope and attached to the tip of a stretched glass fiber. Bruker SMART APEXII CCD single-crystal diffractometers were used to collect diffraction data for DZU-115 and −116 at 165 K, Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å), and 100 K, Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54184 Å), respectively. The crystal structures of DZU-115 and −116 complexes were refined with Shell xl-2015 in OLEX2 program. The structure solution was obtained using XS structure-solving program and further optimized using least-squares refinement with SHELXTL software package [42]. Anisotropic displacement parameters were provided for non-hydrogen atoms during the refinement process. The positions of hydrogen atoms on the ligands were determined using the theoretical adding-hydrogen method. Table S1 summarizes the crystal data for DZU-115 and DZU-116. 2.4 Fluorescence measurements To explore the fluorescence recognition potential of DZU-115 and −116 towards DMF solvent, 20 mg of crystal samples were immersed in 1 mL of various solvents such as MeOH, IPA, EA, AC, DMA, DEF, and DMF. The solid-state fluorescence spectra were recorded after a dwell time of 5 min. The fluorescence spectra of two MOFs were acquired using a Hitachi F4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer, while the fluorescence lifetimes and quantum yields of the two MOFs were measured by an Edinburgh FLS980 steady-state/transient fluorescence spectrometer. To assess practicality, filter paper was loaded with DZU-115 material with recognition capabilities, and fluorescent test paper was prepared. The filter paper was dipped into the dispersion of DZU-115 via sonication for 30 min before being allowed to air dry naturally. Solvent vapor contact experiments were conducted on test papers with DZU-115 crystals loaded based on the solvent contact fluorescence color change results of DZU-115. Solid-state fluorescence emission spectra of the test strips were collected prior to solvent vapor exposure experiments. Add 3 mL of the corresponding solvent to each 100 mL reagent bottle and place the glass bottle containing the test strips into the reagent bottle. After 4 h, the test strips were removed and quickly sealed, and the solid-state fluorescence spectra of the test strips were tested separately to observe the peak shifts before and after exposure to solvent vapor.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "DZU-115", "Syns_method": "solvent-induced crystallization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "H3TCA", "amount": "4 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "BPPB", "amount": "4 mg"}, "prc3": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "10 mg"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMA", "amount": "2.0 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "0.1 mL"}}, "parameters": {"temperature": "90 °C", "time": "24 h"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "filtration"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "wash", "substances": [{"name": "DMA"}, {"name": "acetone"}], "parameters": {"times": "three times"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "air-dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "room temperature"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "DZU-116", "Syns_method": "solvent-induced crystallization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "H3TCA", "amount": "4 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "BPPB", "amount": "4 mg"}, "prc3": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "10 mg"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMA", "amount": "2.0 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "0.1 mL"}, "sov3": {"name": "acetonitrile", "amount": "1 mL"}}, "parameters": {"temperature": "90 °C", "time": "24 h"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "filtration"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "wash", "substances": [{"name": "DMA"}], "parameters": {"times": "three times"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "air-dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "room temperature"}}}}}}}

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Raman spectrometer, XPS, UV-vis DRS, and photoluminescence (PL) were employed to characterize the Ag2ZrO3/TiO2 composites. In an orthodox three-electrode system with RhB electrolyte solution, electrochemical measurements were carried out, and the results showed that it was a remarkable reversible reaction with reliable stabilization and favorable dynamics properties. The photocatalytic performances of Ag2ZrO3/TiO2 composites were estimated via the dilapidation of RhB under visible-light irradiation.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis procedure Layered Mn5O8 was obtained by thermal decomposition of manganite, γ-MnOOH. The initial reagent γ-MnOOH was formed after precipitation of 50 wt% Mn(SO4)2 solution (5.377 g MnSO4 in 50 ml water) with 30 wt% NaOH (2.16 g NaOH in 90 ml water) in the presence of 10 ml H2O2. The as-formed brown suspension was aged at room temperature overnight. Then the suspension was filtered and washed by distilled water and ethanol, followed by drying at 50 °C for a several hours. The black powder (i.e. 0.5 g) was mixed with 100 ml of 1 M solution of MgCl2. The mixture was stirred for 24 h and the product γ-MnOOH was isolated by filtration, thoroughly washed with water and dried at 110 °C. Thermal treatment of γ-MnOOH at 500 °C for 3 h with heating rate 5 °C/min leads to a formation of target compound Mn5O8. All chemicals in this work (MnSO4, NaOH, H2O2 и MgCl2) are with high purity and were used as received without further purification. 2.2 Characterization methods The thermal properties of manganese oxides were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis. Simultaneous TG-DTA curves were obtained applying a combined apparatus for thermal analysis LABSYSEvo, SETARAM Company, France in the temperature range 25–500 °C. Corundum crucibles with a volume of 100 μl were used. The sample weight was 27 mg. The experiments were carried out in dynamic mode, with heating rates of 5 °C/min. The X-ray powder diffractions were collected within the range from 10° to 70° 2θ with a step 0.02° 2θ and counting time 35 s/step on Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The lattice parameters were calculated using the program PowderCell 2.4 (Kraus W, Nolze G., 2000, PowderCell for Windows, version 2.4). The morphology of samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM experiments of the samples were performed on a JSM 5510 electron microscope (Japan) in regimes of secondary electron image (SEI). The accelerating voltage was 10 kV. The samples were gold coated with coating times of ∼40 s. The size of the particles is measured additionally with program LINCE-Linear Intercept v.2.4.2. The TEM experiments were undertaken using a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope and a JEOL 2100 XEDS: Oxford Instruments, X-MAX N 80T CCD Camera ORIUS 1000, 11 Mp, GATAN at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The specimens were prepared by grinding and disintegrating the powders in acetone by ultrasonic treatment for 6 min. The suspensions were then dripped on standard holey carbon/Cu grids. The analysis was carried out by the Digital Micrograph software. The EPR spectra of the powder samples were recorded as the first derivative of the absorption signal of a Bruker EMXplus EPR spectrometer in the X-band (9.4 GHz) within the temperature range of 120–450 K. The relative EPR intensity was determined by double integration of the signal, registered in the form of the first derivative. The spectra were simulated by using the program SIMFONIA (Bruker). Infrared vibrational spectra are registered on a Fourier transform interferometer model Nicolet iS5 (resolution < 2 cm−1) at room temperature using KBr discs as matrices. No ion exchange or other reactions with KBr have been observed. The intercalation properties of manganese oxides were determined in Swagelok type two-electrode cells versus lithium anode working with lithium and magnesium electrolytes. The cells consist of Li|LiPF6(EC:DMC)|Mn5O8 and Li|MgTFSI(diglyme)|Mn5O8, respectively. The positive electrodes were fabricated from a mixture containing 75% of the active compositions, 10% poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), 7.5% C-NERGY KS 6 L graphite (TIMCAL) and 7.5% Super C65 (TIMCAL). The loaded mass of active materials, supported onto Al-collectors with high purity, was about 2 ÷ 3.5 mg. The used electrolytes were 1 M LiPF6 solution in ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate (1:1 by volume) and 0.5 M MgTFSI (magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide)) in diglyme (bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether) with less than 20 ppm of water. The negative electrodes consisted of a pure Li-metal disk with diameter of 10 mm. The assembling of the cells was made in a glove box under argon atmosphere. The electrochemical tests were performed on eight-channel system Arbin BT2000 in galvanostatic mode. The charge/discharge rates were expressed as C/h, where h is the time interval in hours, needed for the insertion of one Li+ ion per formula unit at the applied current intensity. The model cells were cycled between 4.7 and 1.7 V at C/20, C/10, C/5 and C/1 rates.

Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), methanol (MeOH), Triton X-100, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were purchased from Solarbio. Graphene oxide (GO) was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). The ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH), chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium oleate (NaOL), silver nitrate (AgNO3), l-ascorbic acid (AA), sulfur (S), polyethylene glycol (PEG-400), tryptophan (Trp), 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-amBzIM), 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIM), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2﹒6H2O), sodium chloride (NaCl), magnesium chloride (MgCl2), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), bovine albumin (BSA), matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) were procured from Sigma Aldrich. The P-glycoprotein antibody and the poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) antibody were purchased from Proteintech. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Alexa Fluor 594 dye, paraformaldehyde, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were sourced from Thermo Fisher. The sequences of DNA and cDNA were chosen based on previous literature [32], and are shown below. All DNA sequences were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Changchun, China) and stocked in buffer solutions (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0). cDNA: 5′- AAA CCA ACC CAA CAC AAA–SH–3′ DNA: 5′- HOOC-AAA TCG TAT GGC ACG GGG TTG GTG TTG GGT TGG AAA-3′ 2.2 Preparation of rGO-Au NRs Herein, 3 mL of freshly prepared 0.3 g mL−1 NaBH4 was rapidly added to 5 mL of 1 mg mL−1 GO and vigorously stirred for 4 h. After undergoing centrifugal washing three times, the GO was successfully reduced (rGO) and stored at room temperature. Notably, the preparation of Au nanorods (Au NRs) was reported in a previous study with slight modifications [33]. Then, 5 mL of 0.5 mM HAuCl4 was mixed with an equal volume of 0.2 M CTAB. This was followed by the addition of 0.6 mL of 0.01 M NaBH4 to prepare the seed solution. To prepare the growth solution, 3.6 g of CTAB, 0.4936 g of NaOL, and 7.2 mL of 4 mM AgNO3 were mixed with 250 mL of double-distilled water (dd water) and left to stand for 15 min. To this mixture, 100 mL of 1 mM HAuCl4 and 0.5 mL of 0.064 M AA were injected and subsequently waited for 30 s. The seed (0.16 mL) was then dropped into the growth solution and kept overnight at 30 °C. The mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm, following which the precipitate was collected and suspended in dd water to obtain the Au NRs. To obtain the rGO-Au NRs, 10 mL of rGO and 10 mL of Au NRs were mixed and shaken for 4 h, and subsequently stored at 4 °C for future use. 2.3 Preparation of ZIF-8@Au NPs@S QDs To obtain the S QDs, 0.7 g of sublimated sulfur powders, 1.5 mL of PEG-400, 2 g NaOH, and 25 mL of dd water were kept in the Teflon-lined autoclave at 70 °C for 72 h; then, 3.75 wt% H2O2 was used for etching QDs. The highly luminescent S QDs were obtained by freeze-drying and stored at 4 °C. The Au NPs were synthesized by injecting 1.5 mL of 50 mM Trp (0.2 mL min−1) in 25 mL of 0.1 mM HAuCl4 and boiling for 30 min. The resulting colloid suspension was centrifuged, washed, and subsequently underwent ultrasonic dispersion for 15 min to obtain the Au NPs. The ZIF-8@Au NPs@S QDs composite was prepared as follows: 0.2745 g of 2-amBzIM and 0.67 g of 2-MeIM were dissolved in 25 mL of MeOH and stirred at 50 °C for 2 h. Then, 0.2368 g of Zn (NO3)2, 0.5 mL of 5 mg mL−1 S QDs, and 2 mL of Au NPs were added for reaction and thoroughly stirred for 1.5 h. The resulting products were separated via centrifugation and subsequently obtained by vacuum drying. 2.4 Preparation of aptamer sensor The rGO-Au NRs were dropped onto the polished sensor surface and dried in the dark. The modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was immersed in the cDNA buffer solution, after which the Tris buffer was used to lightly rinse the non-specific binding sequences. Besides, cDNA-Au NRs-rGO/GCE incubated with 1 % BSA was utilized to block the unconnected active site. To activate carboxyl, 50 μL of 10 μM DNA, 500 μL of 400 mM EDC, and 100 mM NHS were added into the Tris-HCl buffer. Then, 1 mL of 1 mg mL−1 ZIF-8@Au NPs@S QDs is added into the above solution and reacted for 1 h. Finally, the DNA-ZIF-8@Au NPs@S QDs were prepared after centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Furthermore, the cDNA-Au NRs-rGO/GCE were decorated in the DNA-ZIF-8@Au NPs@S QDs solution at room temperature for 2.5 h. Eventually, rGO-AuNRs-cDNA-DNA-ZIF-8@Au NPs@S QDs were obtained for the detection of MMP9. 2.5 Instrument and analysis The morphology and structure were analyzed using the FEI Tecnai G2 F30, and the mapping images were acquired on the FEI Tecnai G2 F30, FEI Company. Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an IRTracer 100 (Shimadzu) and a Rigaku/SmartLab SE (Rigaku), respectively. The zeta potential distribution was evaluated by the zeta potential analyzer (ZetasizerNanoZ, Malvern Panalytical). The electrochemical experiments were conducted using a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation coupled with a three-electrode system. The fluorescence intensity of the system was quantified using the RF-6000, Shimadzu. The absorption spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer (UV-8000, Shanghai Metash Instruments Co., Ltd.). 2.6 Cell culture and immunofluorescence The MCF-7, MCF-7/ADR, and HeLa cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640, and the HEPG2 cell lines were cultured in DMEM. Notably, the total culture medium included 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U mL−1 penicillin, and 100 μg mL−1 streptomycin. The cells were grown in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded onto two 6-well plates for immunofluorescence. Moreover, the cells were fixed with 1 mL of 4 % paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1 mL of 0.3 % Triton, and blocked with 1 mL of 3 % BSA in PBS. The cells were subsequently incubated with 800 μL (1:1000) of primary antibodies for 18 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with 200 μL of fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies in the dark. Finally, cellular staining was performed using 800 μL of Hoechst 33342.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental Methods\nSynthesis Method\nAll chemicals employed in this study were of analytical grade, sourced from Merck, and were used directly without any further purification. The precursors employed included titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP; C12H28O4Ti), ZrO2 powder, ammonia solution (NH3; 25% w/v), ethanol (C3H8O2), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB; C19H42BrN), and double deionized (DDI) water. Furthermore, methylene blue (C16H18ClN3S) dye was employed to conduct photodegradation experiments.\nTo synthesize TiO2 using the sol-gel technique, initially, 40.0 mg of CTAB was mixed with ethanol (16.0 mL) and stirred continuously for 30 min to get a transparent solution. Then, TTIP (2.5 mL) was added gradually while stirring. Subsequently, 1.2 mL of ammonia was added dropwise, which resulted in the gradual observation of sediment particles, and the solution’s pH was changed from 4.53 to 9.30 by the addition of ammonia. After stirring for 30 min, a homogeneous turbid solution was achieved. It was then allowed to age for 24 h at room temperature (~25 °C) before undergoing multiple rounds of centrifugation (4000 rpm for 4 mins) and filtration with deionized water. The obtained powder was dried at 100 °C for 24 h and then baked for 3 h at 500 °C. Figure 1a presents a diagram outlining the synthesis approach.\nFig .1\nSchematic representation of the preparation method of (a) TiO2 and (b) ZrO2/TiO2 nanopowders\nFull size image\nThe synthesis of ZrO2/TiO2 nanocomposite was started by mixing 9.0 mg of the synthesized TiO2 powder with ethanol in a ratio of 1 to 5. The solution was then placed on a stirrer for 30 min, afterwards 50.0 mg of ZrO2 was slowly added while stirring. Subsequently, the solution was heated in an oven at 500 °C for 1 h. Lastly, the resultant white powder was grounded and the sample was labeled as ZT1. Similarly, 15 and 25 mg of TiO2 powder were mixed with 50.0 mg of ZrO2 in a container, and this process was repeated, resulting in the extracted powders being designated as ZT2 and ZT3, respectively. So, the TiO2 to ZrO2 weight ratio was considered to be about 18, 30, and 50 %, for ZT1, ZT2, and ZT3, respectively. Figure 1b presents a schematic representation of the method used for synthesizing the prepared powders.\nDye Degradation Test\nTo investigate the photocatalytic activity of the produced powders, methylene blue dye was used as a model effluent solution for the degradation study, given that there was no available industrial wastewater containing pure MB. The degradation of MB due to UV light exposure (12W, 360 nm) was investigated by combining 6.0 mg of the catalyst with 100.0 mL of deionized water and 1.0 mg of MB. [37]. In this research, the pH of the solutions was kept steady at a value of 10.0, as will be explained in the last section. To maintain a pH of 10, NaOH was added gradually. The mixture was stirred in the dark for 10 min to allow for the establishment of adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Every 20 min, 2.0 mL of the solution was sampled, and its absorption peak was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer to quantitatively assess the concentration of MB.\nCharacterization Techniques\nAll measurements were performed at room temperature. The morphological and elemental analyses of the prepared powders were studied using a Zeiss Sigma300 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), equipped with an Oxford AZtech 1.0 energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. The structural analysis was accomplished in the scanning range of 10–80° by a Panalytical X’Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer having a CuKα1 (0.15406 nm) target.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental procedure 2.1 Raw materials Magnesium (purity 99.95 %, Nanografi), zinc (purity 99.9 %, Alfa Aesar) and titanium diboride (purity 99.5 %, Alfa Aesar) powders and MWCNTs (purity 90 %, 9.5 nm in diameter, 1.5 μm in length, Nanografi) were provided commercially from the market. The average size of Mg, Zn and TiB2 powders was measured by a particle size analyzer (Malvern Mastersizer 3000). And also, the raw powders were visualized with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI Quanta 650) to see their shapes. 2.2 Fabrication of composites The Mg, Zn, MWCNT and TiB2 powders were mechanically alloyed with an attritor mill to get Mg3Zn alloy (MC0) and Mg3Zn/4TiB2-1MWCNT (MC5), Mg3Zn/9TiB2-1MWCNT (MC10), Mg3Zn/14TiB2-1MWCNT (MC15) composite powders. The total hybrid reinforcement content in the investigated materials was considered to be 0, 5, 10 and 15 vol %. In the nanocomposites, the amount of MWCNT was fixed and 1 vol % whereas, that of TiB2 was 4, 9 and 14 vol % for the MC5, MC10 and MC15, respectively. The ball milling operation was carried out in an argon environment to prevent the powder mixtures from oxidation. The stainless steel balls (10 mm in diameter) were used during this operation. In order to balance cold wetting and breaking of powders in the course of milling, stearic acid (0.5 wt %) and ethanol (2.5 wt %) were used together. The ball-to-powder ratio was taken to be 10:1 by weight to enable an effective milling action which was applied at a speed of 300 rev/min during 4 h. In order to prevent the excessive heating of powders, the tank is cooled continuously with the circulation of water around it. And then, the size distribution of alloy and composite powders were measured by means of Malvern Mastersizer 3000. After that, the powder mixtures were cold compacted uniaxially at 600 MPa for 2 min with the aid of a hydraulic press to produce disk shaped green samples having 16 mm in diameter. The compaction pressure of 600 MPa was chosen to attain the samples with high green density. Next, the two-step sintering operation of the green samples, debinding at 350 °C for 30 min followed by consolidation at 560 °C for 60 min, was made under an argon atmosphere in a tubular furnace to complete the production cycle. The first step of sintering, namely debinding was made for the evaporation of stearic acid from the samples. The density of sintered Mg3Zn alloy and its nanocomposite samples was measured using the Archimedes’ principle [17]. 2.3 Microstructural examinations Both the mechanical alloyed (MA) and sintered powders were subjected to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to reveal the crystallite size and phases (elemental or compound) related to the process and composition. This analysis was made by means of an X-Ray Diffractometer (PANalytical EMPYREAN with Cu Kα radiation of 1.5406 Å wavelength) at 2θ range of 10° and 90° and a scanning rate of 2° min−1. The data gained from the XRD patterns were evaluated with the HighScore plus [18,19] and the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) [20]. And then, the phases occurred within the specimens were identified using these XRD patterns while the crystallite size of all investigated materials was calculated by the Scherrer's equation mentioned below [21]: (1) D = 0.9 · λ B · cos θ D represents mean crystallite size while λ and θ symbolize wavelength of X-ray radiation and Bragg angle, respectively. B stands for line broadening which corresponds to full-width at half maximum of the highest diffraction peak [21,22]. Meantime, the samples were prepared by grinding, polishing and etching with the reagent (5 g picric acid, 5 ml acetic acid, 100 ml ethanol and 10 ml water) prior to the microscopic analysis. They were examined using an SEM (FEI Quanta 650) to determine their microstructural characteristics, e.g., distribution of elements and reinforcements. 2.4 Mechanical tests The microhardness test of Mg3Zn nanocomposites was performed with the aid of a microhardness tester (FUTURE-TECH FM-700) by exerting a load of 50 g in accordance with ASTM E384 – 17 [23]. The average of five micro hardness measurements was recorded for each sample. Meanwhile, the compression tests were applied to the cylindrical samples (Ø16 × 16 mm) with the aid of a testing machine (SHIMADZU AG-IC) according to ASTM E9 – 19 [24]. These tests were made by applying a crosshead speed of 0.12 mm⋅min−1 and repeated three times for each case. 2.5 Wear test The sliding wear tests of Mg3Zn nanocomposites were made using a ball-on-disk type tribometer (CSM Instruments) in compliance with ASTM G99-17 [25]. A load of 5 N was exerted on the materials by a 6-mm diameter 100Cr6 steel ball. The tests were made at a sliding speed of 0.1 m s−1 along with a distance of 500 m. In addition, the mean of three identical measurements was recorded to get the wear loss of tested materials. As a final step in the wear tests, the worn surfaces and wear debris of Mg3Zn nanocomposites were evaluated with an SEM (FEI Quanta 650) to clarify wear mechanisms. 2.6 Corrosion test The corrosion behavior of the Mg3Zn nanocomposites in 3.5 % NaCl solution was investigated with potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) curves. In order to derive these curves, an electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, CHI660E) with a three-electrode technique was utilized. In the electrochemical corrosion experiments, Ag/AgCl and platin electrodes were considered as the reference and counter electrodes, successively while the Mg3Zn composite samples were used as the working electrode. One of the flat surface (1 cm2) of the disk-shaped specimens was considered to be exposed to the corrosive medium in the electrochemical cell while their remaining surface was coated with an epoxy based adhesive. Before the PDP measurements, the open circuit potential (OCP) was saved during 1800 s to reach a stabilized potential. The PDP experiments were made in the range of OCP ±0.25 V and at a scanning rate of 0.5 mV/s. Finally, the corrosion rates (CRs) were identified with the aid of Tafel extrapolation.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Mg3Zn alloy", "Syns_method": "mechanical alloying", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Mg", "amount": "calculated amount"}, "prc2": {"name": "Zn", "amount": "calculated amount"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "2.5 wt%"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ball_milling", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "4 h", "speed": "300 rev/min"}, "substances": [{"name": "stearic acid", "amount": "0.5 wt%"}]}, "post_proc2": {"step": "cold_compaction", "parameters": {"pressure": "600 MPa", "time": "2 min"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "debinding", "parameters": {"temperature": "350 °C", "time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "consolidation", "parameters": {"temperature": "560 °C", "time": "60 min"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Mg3Zn/4TiB2-1MWCNT", "Syns_method": "mechanical alloying", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Mg3Zn alloy", "amount": "95 vol%"}, "prc2": {"name": "TiB2", "amount": "4 vol%"}, "prc3": {"name": "MWCNT", "amount": "1 vol%"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "2.5 wt%"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ball_milling", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "4 h", "speed": "300 rev/min"}, "substances": [{"name": "stearic acid", "amount": "0.5 wt%"}]}, "post_proc2": {"step": "cold_compaction", "parameters": {"pressure": "600 MPa", "time": "2 min"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "debinding", "parameters": {"temperature": "350 °C", "time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "consolidation", "parameters": {"temperature": "560 °C", "time": "60 min"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "Mg3Zn/9TiB2-1MWCNT", "Syns_method": "mechanical alloying", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Mg3Zn alloy", "amount": "90 vol%"}, "prc2": {"name": "TiB2", "amount": "9 vol%"}, "prc3": {"name": "MWCNT", "amount": "1 vol%"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "2.5 wt%"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ball_milling", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "4 h", "speed": "300 rev/min"}, "substances": [{"name": "stearic acid", "amount": "0.5 wt%"}]}, "post_proc2": {"step": "cold_compaction", "parameters": {"pressure": "600 MPa", "time": "2 min"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "debinding", "parameters": {"temperature": "350 °C", "time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "consolidation", "parameters": {"temperature": "560 °C", "time": "60 min"}}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "Mg3Zn/14TiB2-1MWCNT", "Syns_method": "mechanical alloying", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Mg3Zn alloy", "amount": "85 vol%"}, "prc2": {"name": "TiB2", "amount": "14 vol%"}, "prc3": {"name": "MWCNT", "amount": "1 vol%"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "2.5 wt%"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ball_milling", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "4 h", "speed": "300 rev/min"}, "substances": [{"name": "stearic acid", "amount": "0.5 wt%"}]}, "post_proc2": {"step": "cold_compaction", "parameters": {"pressure": "600 MPa", "time": "2 min"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "debinding", "parameters": {"temperature": "350 °C", "time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "consolidation", "parameters": {"temperature": "560 °C", "time": "60 min"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Abstract\nIn this present study the biodegradable PLA/PBAT blend incorporated cardanol oil (CO) along with various nanoparticles (Nps) was fabricated by film casting technique. The primary goal of this work was to address and solve the incompatibility problem that exists between PLA and PBAT blending by introducing green chemical based natural additive cardanol oil as compatibilizer in PLA/PBAT biodegradable polymer blend. The packaging films were developed using various formulations of PLA/PBAT (90/10) biopolymer blend added with cardanol oil as compatibilizing agent and 1wt.% of ZnO, TiO2, and SiO2 as nanofiller. All of the developed PLA/PBAT blended biodegradable films were subjected to various characterizations such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, surface and inner morphology, X-ray diffraction, mechanical, thermal degradation, optical, surface hydrophobicity and antibacterial behaviour. The mechanical performance of the prepared film revealed that incorporating 1wt.% NPs (ZnO, TiO2, and SiO2) along with 5wt.% cardanol oil into the composite film improves tensile strength and percentage of elongation. The PLA/PBAT blended film containing both NPs and cardanol oil has a lower OTR and WVTR value and indicating that the flexible film has good barrier properties. The presence of both cardanol oil and NPs in the PLA/PBAT improved the optical properties and surface hydrophobicity. Finally, based on the experimental results obtained in this study, it is inferred that the PLA/PBAT/NPs/CO biodegradable films have high potential for the use in food packaging applications due to their improved packaging performances such as film flexibility, less water permeability, heat withstand ability, less water absorptiveness and good antimicrobial properties.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "PLA/PBAT/NPs/CO (PLA/PBAT blend with cardanol oil and 1wt.% ZnO/TiO2/SiO2 nanoparticles)", "application": "food packaging materials", "props": {}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Biomass samples Peanut shells (from now named as PS) were obtained from AGD Company, Córdoba, Argentina. Initially the dried biomass was pulverized and washed with distilled water, then dried for 24 h. After that, two sets of PS were prepared. In one set, the dried PS was pre-treated by impregnation with phosphoric acid (Anedra, 85% w/w) solutions. In this procedure 1.00 g of PS and 5 mL of 5% (w/w) phosphoric acid aqueous solution (H3PO4/peanut shell mass ratio 1:4) were introduced in a round bottom flask and kept at 70–80 °C under magnetic stirring. After 2 h, the mixture was filtered under vacuum and the solid was dried at 40 °C under vacuum overnight. This material is designated as APS. In the other set, the dried PS were activated in 100 mL of KOH (7% w/w) (KOH/peanut shell weight ratio 1:3) for 4 h at 80 °C under magnetic stirring. Then the mixture was filtered under vacuum and the solid was dried at 40 °C under vacuum overnight, this material is named BPS from now on. 2.2 Synthesis of biocarbon from biomass One set of carbon was obtained directly by fast pyrolysis at 300 °C of untreated peanut shells (called PS-B from now on). For the preparation of the other set of biocarbon, the chemical pre-treated PS samples (APS and BPS) were pyrolysed in a tube furnace at the same temperature. These materials are named as APS-B and BPS-B respectively. Additionally, APS-B and BPS-B were extensively washed with distilled water to remove remaining impurities and leave the porous structures free. These carbon are designated as APS-B(W) and BPS-B(W). The different conditions to obtain the carbonaceous materials are summarized in Fig. 1 . In all the cases, the pyrolysis treatment was performed in inert atmosphere in a quartz tubular reactor with a length of 25.00 cm and a diameter of 2.50 cm inside a furnace having a temperature-controller device. The reactor was connected to a high vacuum pump reaching pressures values of 1–5 Torr during the experiments (Scheme 1, Supporting Information). Biomass samples (1.00 g) were placed in a sliding ceramic boat, which was put into the pyrolysis furnace once the reaction temperature of 300 °C and the vacuum conditions were attained (fast-pyrolysis). To improve the transportation of volatile products to a liquid nitrogen trap situated at the exit point of the furnace (condensation region), an inert carrier gas (oxygen-free dry nitrogen), with a flow rate of 0.1 mL s−1, was employed. Thus, the sample was subjected to pyrolysis temperature at a short residence times (<5 s) and the experiments lasted 20 min to get the conversion of the entire material. Carbon materials were removed from the ceramic boat and also weighed. The yields are expressed as the average of at least three experiments to confirm reproducibility of the results reported (Supporting information Table S1). 2.3 Materials characterization Biomass characterization was performed using various analytical methods. Elemental analyses were performed by a CHNS Elemental Analyzer 2400 Serie II PerkinElmer. Total ash content of the biomass material was determined via combustion of the biomass at 575 °C for 24 h. The moisture content of the samples was determined using a Mettler Toledo halogen moisture analyzer. About 1.00 g of the sample was weighed into the moisture analyzer and the moisture content was determined at 105 °C. The lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose content were determined using an ANKOM 200 fiber analyzer (ANKOM Technologies, USA), following the method described by Goering and Van Soest with modifications [28]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Pan-Analytical diffractometer with the Cu-Kα radiation (l = 1.5406 Å). The different biocarbon morphologies were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with a field emission scanning electron microscope FE-SEM, Sigma Zeiss (LAMARX facilities). Elemental analysis was performed on an energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrometer attached to FE-SEM. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, Q500, TA Instrument Corporation) in nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 600 °C. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and total micro- and meso-pore volume of the biochars were measured at least in duplicate by nitrogen gas sorption at 77 K using a NOVA 1000e porosimeter (Quantachrome, Boynton Beach, FL, USA). Samples were vacuum degassed overnight at 160 °C prior to analysis. The X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectrum was obtained through Thermo Scientific™ K-Alpha™+ X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer. 2.4 Electrode fabrication, cell assembly and electrochemical characterization To prepare the carbon/sulfur composite for the electrodes 30 wt% of each carbon, and 70 wt% of sulfur powder (Sigma Aldrich) were uniformly mixed and heated at 155 °C in argon atmosphere. The final amounts of sulfur in the impregnated carbon were obtained by TGA measurements and the specific capacity for each material was calculated taking this in consideration. The working electrode was fabricated by ball milling for 25 min at 600 rpm 80 wt% of the as prepared mixture of biocarbon/sulfur, 10 wt % of conductor carbon (Super P, Timcal, MTI) and 10 wt% of polyvinilidene fluoride (PVdF), using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) [29] as solvent to obtain uniform slurries. The slurries were coated onto aluminum foil by doctor blade method and dried in oven at 80 °C for 2 h to be finally stored in glovebox under argon atmosphere until used. The electrodes were cut into 12 mm diameter circles. The average sulfur loading on the electrode disks was around 0.6 mg cm−2. CR2032 coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox using lithium foil as anode and 1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide) (LiTFSI) and 0.25 M LiNO3 dissolved in 1:1 (by volume) mixture of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1, 2-dimethoxyethane (DME) as the electrolyte; 40 μL of electrolyte was used in each cell. The cycling performance of the cells was tested using an Arbin battery tester in a potential range of 1.8–2.3 V at room temperature, using a specific current of 0.1 mA/mg.

Specifically, 5 g of TiO2 powder (Tianjin Dingsheng Xin Chemical Co., Ltd., China) was slowly added into 65 ml of 10 mol/L sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (Tianjin Dingsheng Xin Chemical Co., Ltd., China) solution under ultrasonic-magnetic stirring, and after continuous stirring for 1 h, the above mixed system was transferred to a 100 mol hydrothermal reactor and hydrothermally reacted at 180 °C for 12 h. After fully reacted, the precipitate was taken out from the reactor, centrifugally separated and then washed with water for two times. Subsequently, the obtained products were placed in 1 mol/L HCl (Hydrochloric acid) for acidification treatment for 24 h, and then washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol by repeated centrifugation. Finally, pitting the sample into a muffle furnace (T-1700NT, Zhengzhou Tianzhong Electric Equipment Co., Ltd., China) and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h to obtain the TiO2 nanobelts. 2.2 Preparation of nano-vitrified bonds 2.2.1 Preparation of basic vitrified bonds Table 1 shows the components of the basic vitrified bonds and their corresponding weight ratios. The corresponding preparation process is shown in Fig. 1b. Firstly, each raw material was accurately weighed and thoroughly mixed according to the formulation proportions shown in Table 1. Then the mixed powder was placed in a high-temperature melting furnace (SG2, Luoyang Hengyu Instrumentation Co., Ltd., China) to be melted at 1450 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the resulting high temperature melt was quenched in a large amount of cool water. After drying at 120 °C for 8 h, the as-received glass frits were ground using a fast grinding machine (YJKS-single jar, Foshan Yejin Electromechanical Equipment Co., Ltd., China). After the grinding products were further sieved through 200-mesh, the basic vitrified bond powder was obtained. 2.2.2 Preparation of nano-vitrified bonds TiO2 nanobelts with different contents (0 wt%, 0.1 wt%, 0.2 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, and 2 wt%) were added into the basic vitrified bonds. Due to the non-dispersible nature of the nanobelts, sonochemical and mechanical mixing methods were used to ensure the uniform distribution of the nanobelts in the vitrified bonds. Then, the above mixed systems were dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain nano-vitrified bond powders. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Tianjin Kemio Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) solution with a concentration of 0.5 wt% was added to the prepared nano-vitrified bond powders in a ratio of 5 wt%. After thorough mixing, it was sealed and aged for 24 h before being pressed and formed according to the molding density of 2.49 g/cm³ to obtain 35 mm × 6 mm × 6 mm specimen strips and 8 mm × 8 mm specimen columns, respectively. These specimens were placed in an oven for drying. According to the experimental requirements, each group of specimen strips and columns was placed in a resistance furnace (SX2-5-12G, Zhongshan North Road, Putuo District, Shanghai, China) for sintering. Finally, the samples were cooled to room temperature in the furnace. Through the above process, a sample of nano-vitrified bond samples were obtained for subsequent testing and performance evaluation. The detailed process flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1c. 2.3 Preparation of CBN vitrified bond composites 100 parts each of CBN (with an average particle size of 0.5 mm, Funak Superhard Materials Co., Ltd., China) and white corundum (with an average particle size of 0.18 mm, Shanxi Taiyue Composite Materials Co., Ltd. , China) were taken and set aside. Then, 32 portions of nano-vitrified binder were added to the above material, as well as 5 wt% and 1.5 wt% of PVA and dextrin powder, respectively. Subsequently, the aforementioned mixed systems were thoroughly mixed and sealed for 24 h for the compression of vitrified bond CBN composites, using the same method as the relevant part of the nano-vitrified bond samples. When the resulting powders were pressed and molded, the density was set at 2.6 g/cm³, and a certain molding pressure was applied. Pressurized specimens were placed in a drying oven (Model DZF-1B, Shanghai Botai Experimental Equipment Co., Ltd., China) and dried at 60 °C for 24 h to remove excess water. Finally, the dried specimens were sintered in a muffle furnace (SX2-5-12G, Zhengzhou Tianzong Electrical Equipment Co., Ltd., China). 2.4 Characterizations The X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) was used to investigate the crystalline phase of the vitrified bonds. The experimental parameters were configured at a copper target and K α -rays were utilized, tube voltage set as 40 kV, and the current was 100 mA. The scanning angle ranged from 10° to 90°, and the scanning rate was 10°/min in steps of 0.02°. The fractured nano-vitrified bonds or CBN composites were tested after flexural strength tests, and fracture morphology, porosity morphology, and distribution within the specimens were observed using a scanning electron microscope (INSPECT F50, FEI USA Ltd.). The dispersion and aggregation of the prepared specimens were observed using a transmission electron microscope (H-8100, Hitachi). The flexural strength of the sample was conducted through a microcomputer-controlled electronic universal testing machine (CMT4504, Sixty-nine Thirteen Factory, Chinese Liberation Army). The Rockwell was detected using a Rockwell tester (HR-150, Wuzhong Material Testing Machine Factory) by placing the specimen block on the hardness tester carrier table. The porosities of sintered vitrified bond CBN composites were determined using the traditional Archimedean method. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CET) of the nano-vitrified bond samples were obtained using a differential thermal expansion instrument (WCP-2, Beijing Optical Instrument Factory, China).", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "TiO2 nanobelts", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "TiO2", "amount": "5 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "NaOH", "amount": "65 mL 10 mol/L"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "deionized water"}, "sov2": {"name": "HCl", "amount": "1 mol/L"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "180 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "acidification", "substance": [{"name": "HCl", "amount": "1 mol/L"}], "parameters": {"time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "450 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "nano-vitrified bonds", "Syns_method": "mechanical mixing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "basic vitrified bonds"}, "prc2": {"name": "TiO2 nanobelts", "amount": "0.1-2 wt%"}, "prc3": {"name": "PVA", "amount": "0.5 wt%"}, "prc4": {"name": "dextrin", "amount": "1.5 wt%"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "PVA solution", "amount": "5 wt%"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "press", "parameters": {"density": "2.49 g/cm³"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "sinter", "parameters": {"temperature": "as per furnace specifications"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "CBN vitrified bond composites", "Syns_method": "compression molding", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "CBN", "amount": "100 parts"}, "prc2": {"name": "white corundum", "amount": "100 parts"}, "prc3": {"name": "nano-vitrified bonds", "amount": "32 parts"}, "prc4": {"name": "PVA", "amount": "5 wt%"}, "prc5": {"name": "dextrin", "amount": "1.5 wt%"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "press", "parameters": {"density": "2.6 g/cm³"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "sinter", "parameters": {"temperature": "as per furnace specifications"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis of CAU-17 All chemicals employed in our study are detailed in the Text S1, SI. The synthesis of CAU-17 was carried out through a hydrothermal technique, as documented in the literature (Chen et al., 2020). First, a benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) solution was prepared by dissolving 0.75 g of H3BTC in a solution of CH3OH (55 mL) and H2O (5 mL). Afterwards, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.15 g) was added into the H3BTC solution to achieve a clear solution. This solution was then transferred to a 100 mL autoclave lined with polytetrafluoroethylene, and placed in an oven. After 120 min of hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C, the resulting product was obtained through centrifugation and then underwent methanol washing. Ultimately, CAU-17 was produced as a dry white powder after being maintained in an oven at a temperature of 80 °C overnight. 2.2 Synthesis of CAU-17-derived composites Composite photocatalysts derived from CAU-17 were synthesized in situ employing a facile and mild solvothermal approach. Typically, 0.5 g of CAU-17 was introduced into a mixed solution of dimethylformamide (DMF, 30 mL) and dichloromethane (DCM, 30 mL), followed by sonication for 30 min. Next, the resulting reaction mixture was sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 155 °C for 8 h. The resulting product, denoted as CAU-17-st-8h, underwent purification through three successive washes with DMF, and then dried at 80 °C. Varying the solvothermal reaction duration to 1 h, 4 h, and 16 h resulted in the corresponding products named CAU-17-st-1h, CAU-17-st-4h, and CAU-17-st-16h, respectively. The synthesis procedure for the CAU-17-derived composite photocatalysts is illustrated in Scheme S1, SI. For comparison, BiOCl and BHP nanosheets were synthesized employing the reported methodology with slight adjustments, as detailed in prior studies (Nguyen et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2008). Under ambient conditions, a solution comprising 6 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in a mixture of DMF and DCM (30/30 mL) was prepared. After 30 min stirring period, the mixture was sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The solvothermal process was performed at 155 °C for a duration of 8 h, respectively. The resulting product, referred to as BiOCl, was subjected to three rounds of methanol cleaning and was dried at 80 °C. The synthesis of BHP was conducted under the same conditions, with the exception that the product underwent three rounds of DMF cleaning. 2.3 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using an X-ray Diffractometer (Rigaku/Ultima IV). Each specimen underwent a comprehensive examination of Bragg angles ranging from 5° to 80° (2θ) with a precise angular increment of 0.02°. Fourier-transform infrared analysis of the specimens was conducted with a Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Bruker, Germany). The surface morphology was assessed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM 7401 F model, JEOL) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM 1010 model, JEOL). N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured on a Tristar-3030 instrument (Micromeritics) after degassing the specimens at 150 °C for 12 h to eliminate all surface-adsorbed gases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an AXIS SUPRA spectrometer (KRATOS Analytical Ltd.). Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS) was conducted using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Model UV-2450, Shimadzu). For photoluminescence (PL) analysis, the catalysts were examined with a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). Electrochemical investigations were performed to elucidate the mechanisms governing the transfer processes of photoexcited e−/h+ pairs. Comprehensive details of the electrochemical measurements employed in this study are provided in Text S2, SI. 2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurement The photocatalytic efficacy of the synthesized samples was evaluated through the degradation of two distinct organic pollutants, namely, RhB dye and SMX antibiotic. These evaluations were carried out under ambient conditions in an aqueous suspension, illuminated by a 40 W LED light source, with a continuous air supply maintained throughout the experiment (Nguyen et al., 2020). In our investigation, 15 mg and 50 mg of the photocatalyst were introduced into 100 mL solutions of RhB (3 × 10−5 M) and SMX (15 ppm), respectively. The suspension was stirred in the dark for 60 min to attain adsorption-desorption equilibrium. At predetermined intervals, three mL of the suspension was withdrawn from the reactor and subjected to centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min, facilitating subsequent spectrophotometric analysis using the Cary 60 UV–visible spectrophotometer and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) device. The detailed HPLC measurements employed in this study can be found in Text S3, SI. Furthermore, a thorough investigation was undertaken to analyze the intermediates generated during the antibiotic fragmentation process induced in the CAU-17-st-8h sample under LED light irradiation. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was employed for this comprehensive analysis. To elucidate the primary active species participating in the photocatalytic reaction, a series of experiments inquiries employing radical capture methodologies were conducted. Prior to the standard photocatalytic tests, concentrations of 2 × 10−4 M for isopropanol (IPA), benzoquinone (BQ), sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4), and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) were introduced into the mixture of SMX and photocatalyst. These compounds serve as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (•OH), superoxide anion radicals (O2 •−), holes (h+), and electrons (e−), respectively (Nguyen et al., 2020).

In a typical procedure, 3.82 mL of titanium(iv) isopropoxide [(Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4), Sigma Aldrich] was added with continuous stirring to 3.66 mL of isopropyl alcohol [[(CH3)2CHOH], Sigma Aldrich]. The mixture was stirred for a few minutes for dissolving the alkoxide in the alcohol. The ethyl acetoacetate [(C6H10O3), Scharlab] used as a complexing agent was then added to the reaction mixture in a and stirred for about 30 min. The prepared BiVO4 nanoparticles were incorporated into the TiO2 sol before gelling. The amount of BiVO4 nanoparticles necessary to obtain the desired loading in the final composite was added dropwise to the titanium sol with a suitable volume of nitric acid solution (HNO3, 0.1 mol L−1, hydrolysis ratio ) and the resulting mixture was kept under stirring until gel formation. The obtained gel was aged for 24 h and then dried under supercritical conditions of isopropanol (T = 245 °C and P = 50 bar). After that, the solid was calcined under an oxygen flow at 500 °C for 3 h. The composites were labeled as xBV/TiO2 depending on the BiVO4 loading (x = 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 wt%).\nThe photodeposition of Pt on the 0.5BV/TiO2 nanocomposites was performed in a closed system under an Ar atmosphere by stirring 0.150 g of 0.5BV/TiO2 nanocomposites in a water/methanol solution of platinum(iv) chloride hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Sigma Aldrich) to achieve different Pt loadings on the composites (0.1, 0.5, 1.5 and 3 wt%). The suspension was illuminated for 3 h with a Xe arc lamp (150 W Lot Oriel). After Pt photodeposition, the photocatalyst was filtered and washed with methanol before being dried at 80 °C for 8 h. The photocatalysts were labeled as yPt–0.5BV/TiO2, depending on the Pt loading (y = 0.1, 0.5, 1.5 and 3 wt%).\nThe inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) technique was used to determine the chemical composition of the yPt–xBV/TiO2 photocatalysts using a Plasma Quant PQ 9000 equipped with a CCD detector, high-resolution optics, vertical V shuttle torch, dual view PLUS and high-frequency generator.\nThe crystalline structure of the yPt–xBV/TiO2 photocatalysts was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction with an X’Pert Pro PANalytical polycrystal diffractometer with an X’Celerator RTMS detector and nickel-filtered Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The mean crystallite sizes of TiO2 were calculated by applying the Scherrer equation from the value of full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the anatase (101) diffraction peak.\nThe textural properties of the yPt–xBV/TiO2 photocatalysts were determined from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms measured at 77 K. The isotherms were measured in a TRISTAR 3000 apparatus (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA). The samples were degassed under vacuum at 100 °C for 2 h before measurement. The surface areas (SBET) of the samples were calculated by applying the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation to the nitrogen adsorption isotherm within the relative pressures of 0.05 < P/P° < 0.30. The average pore size and distribution were determined by the Barret–Joyner–Halenda method.\nRaman spectra of the yPt–xBV/TiO2 photocatalysts were recorded using a Raman spectrometer confocal microscope WITec/ALPHA 300AR. Laser beams in red (785 nm) and green (532 nm) were used as excitation sources with the power set at 300 mW. Raman spectra were collected with a 50× objective lens with an acquisition time of 2 seconds and 10 acquisitions.\nThe nanomorphology of the photocatalysts was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) in a TEM/STEM JEOL 2100F electron microscope operating at a 200 kV accelerating voltage with a field emission gun (FEG), obtaining a point resolution of 0.19 nm.\nDiffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in the UV-visible region of the yPt–xBV/TiO2 samples was conducted by applying the Kubelka–Munk function with a UV-vis-NIR Varian Cary 5000 spectrometer with double beam and double shutter synchronized electronically in the scan range of 200–700 nm. The band gap energy was obtained from Tauc plots by plotting a tangent line over the slope of the UV-vis spectra.\nThe photoluminescence (PL) spectra of photocatalysts were obtained in a sonicated aqueous suspension and room temperature using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 320 nm.\nThe surface composition of the yPt–xBV/TiO2 samples was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy recorded on a VG Escalab 200R spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, East Grinstead, UK) equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and an Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV) X-ray source. Atomic quantification on the surface of the samples was carried out by integration of the peaks corresponding to Pt, Ti, Bi and V core-levels and the normalization with the corresponding sensitivity factors. The binding energy for all the samples was corrected to the C 1s signal at 284.8 eV.\nThe activity of the yPt–xBV/TiO2 samples was measured in the photo-reduction of aqueous ethanol solutions for hydrogen production under simulated solar-light irradiation. The photoactivity was measured in a closed Pyrex glass reactor at ambient temperature, under an inert atmosphere and illuminated with a solar simulator (150 W Xe arc lamp, ozone free, LOT Oriel GmbH & CO KG, 5% UV radiation) for 5 h. The reactor was loaded with 15 mg of photocatalyst suspended in 150 mL aqueous solution of ethanol (0.05 mol L−1). Prior to light irradiation, the system was purged with an Ar flow for 1.5 h to remove air from the reactor. During the experiment, the suspension was vigorously stirred to achieve homogeneous irradiation and mixing of the photocatalyst particles under light. The gaseous products were sampled at a regular time interval of 60 min using a Hamilton Sample lock gas syringe and the hydrogen production was quantified using a gas chromatograph model Star 3400 CX (Varian, Agilent) equipped with a TCD detector and a 5 Å molecular sieve packed column using Ar as a carrier gas.\n", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "BiVO4/TiO2", "Syns_method": "two-step sol–gel method", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4", "amount": "3.82 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C3H8O", "amount": "3.66 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "age", "parameters": {"time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "245 °C"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "3 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Pt–0.5BV/TiO2", "Syns_method": "Pt photodeposition", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "0.5BV/TiO2", "amount": "0.150 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "illuminate", "parameters": {"time": "3 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "8 h"}}}}}}}

In this study, recycled concrete powder (RCP) was used to support TiO2, and RCP@TiO2 composites (RCPT) were incorporated into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to fabricate an exterior wall self-cleaning coating. The super-hydrophobicity and photocatalytic activity of the resulting coating were modulated by adjusting the dosage of RCPT. The surface roughness was determined through fractal analysis. The findings indicated that the incorporation of RCPT generated micro-/nano-scale structures on the coating surface, which significantly enhanced its hydrophobicity. The water contact angle (WCA) of the coating surface increased with the content of RCPT. When the mass ratio of RCPT to PDMS reached 1, the sliding angle (SA) sharply decreased, resulting in a super-hydrophobic surface with WCA greater than 150° and SA less than 10°. According to the surface roughness, critical points of wetting state transition can be accurately identified. Meanwhile, the coating with the same addition of RCPT exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity. The synergistic effect of super-hydrophobicity and photocatalytic degradation contributed to the enhanced self-cleaning capacity. Due to the lotus effect, the coating exhibited high stain resistance and water repellency. Most pollutants adhering to the coating surface can be removed by rainwater rolling off. In case of fouling by organic pollutants, photocatalytic degradation can decompose adsorbed pollutants, thus restoring the lotus effect.

{"instruction": "Filter the fields from the following text:", "input": "1 Introduction Development of efficient electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies could promote sustainability energy. Compared with the commercial battery energy storage, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their numerous advantages, such as high energy density (2600 Wh/kg), rich raw materials, low cost, which represent the promising next-generation high energy power system [1,2] . However, the poor electronic/ionic conductivity of elemental sulfur and its solid discharge products (Li2S2/Li2S) caused a low utilization of sulfur and rapid capacity fading. Additionally, the dissolution and migration of polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4â€¯â‰¤nâ€¯â‰¤â€¯8) in electrolytes cause the lithium anode corrosion [3,4] . In the past decades, plenty of research concentrated on the aforesaid hindrances has been unscrambled to improve the cycling performance of Li-S cells. The regular stratagem is the combination of sulfur with conductive carbonaceous additives, such as carbon nanofibers/nanotubes [5,6] , graphene [7] and porous carbon with diverse pore sizes [8,9] . Due to their high electrical conductivity accompanied by reasonably designed pore system, porous carbons show high potential to anchor sulfur, trap soluble lithium polysulfides and eliminate volume changes during charge/discharge process [10] . Nevertheless, the carbonaceous hosts alleviate the migration of lithium polysulfides by physical-sorption [11] . The heteroatoms doped carbonaceous materials were used as sulfur host and suppressed lithium polysulfides shuttle effect by chemisorption [12,13] . Nitrogen doped carbonaceous materials with pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N active sites, which have been proved to be an efficient way for chemisorption polysulfides [14,15] . Wang et al reported that the nitrogen (N)-doped graphene can improve the cycle stability for sulfur cathode and explained that N-doping facilitates Li + diffusion and thereby effectively promoting the charge transfer form polysulfide species to N-doped substrates with Li atoms serving as bridges [16] . Song et al. claimed that polysulfide species can be confined due to the enhanced affinity caused by N-doping [17] . In a combined experimental and theoretical work, Li et al. concluded that the improvement in the performance of Li-S batteries originates from the enhanced binding of polysulfide species and N-sites [18] . Other experimental have also indicated that two types of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N are more effective in forming SxLi-N interactions, which result in alleviating Shan-shan Yao et al. / New Carbon Materials, 2021, 36(3): 606-615 dissolution of polysulfide species in the electrolyte and improving their redeposition process during discharge/charge [19,20] . Qiu and Rao calculated the binding energies of Li2Sn on N-doped graphene sheets in detail and showed that compared with pristine graphene, the binding energies of Li2Sn on N-doped samples were significantly increased [21,22] . As stated above, researchers usually calculated binding energies between polysulfide species and N-sites based on density functional theory (DFT). It is well-known that the polysulfide adsorption capability of nitrogen doped carbon is determined by the total amount of introduced nitrogen and its chemical state, which is associated with nitrogen precursors or heat treatment conditions. Also, the specific surface area and the porous structure are one of the important factors that determine the activity [23,24] . As we known, carbonized nanofibers produced from pyrolysis of electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor has received a great amount of attention due to their promising potentials [25,26] . Cho et al. provided an in-depth analysis of electrospun PAN precursor followed by stabilization and carbonization of the nanofibers processed under different pyrolysis temperatures. The results showed that different pyrolysis temperature condition had a significant influence on chemical and morphological characteristics of the products [27] . However, there was no electrochemical analysis conducted in the study to examine the applicability of fabricated material in real application. Meanwhile, in contrast to the traditional solid sulfur melting approach, here we used polysulfide-containing liquid catholyte, which have been often avoided in typical Li-S batteries due to the promotion of the shuttle mechanism. The liquid catholyte (Li2S6), however, can alleviate the aggregation of irreversible S or Li2S, and offer a higher utilization of active materials, comparing to the sluggish reaction of insulating solid phases [28] . Several recent studies also used polysulfide- containing electrolytes as shuttle inhibitors, backups for sulfur, or active materials, but low sulfur loading or/and fast capacity fading of these batteries are still far from satisfactory [29,30] . Herein, in this study, three-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NCFs) derived from PAN was successfully synthesized by a combined electrospining/carbonization technique. NCFs were employed as positive current collector containing Li2S6 catholyte solution for Li-S batteries. As a result, NCFs prepared at 900 â„ƒ (denoted as NCFs-900) shows a higher electronic conductivity, a larger specific area and a higher content of pyridinic-N. The free-standing NCFs-900@Li2S6 electrode (sulfur loading: 4.19 mg cm âˆ’2 ) delivers an initial capacity of 875 mAhÂ·g âˆ’1 at 0.2 C and maintains 707 mAhÂ·g âˆ’1 after 250 cycles. Even at high current density of 1 C, the capacity retention of electrode reaches 81.53% after 150 cycles, which demonstrate the improved cycling stability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Fabrication of NCFs and NCFs@Li2S6 electrode Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCFs) were prepared by a combined electrospinning/carbonization technique. 4 g of polyacrylonitrile (PAN, Mw=150,000) polymer was dispersed into 20 mL of N, N-dimethylformamdie (DMF) solvent with stirring for 24 h to get PAN/DMF solution precursor. The PAN nanofibers were formed under the electrospun condition: working voltage was 15 kV, a feeding rate 0.5 mLÂ·h âˆ’1 and aluminum foil as grounded counter electrode. The as-collected nanofibers were dried overnight under vacuum at 60 â„ƒ and pre-oxidization at 260 â„ƒ for 2 h and then carbonization for 2 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The NCFs prepared at the three different carbonization temperatures were denoted as NCFs-800, NCFs-900 and NCFs-1000, respectively. The schematic illustration of NCFs was shown in Fig. 1 and NCFs membranes were sliced into the disc with the diameter of 12 mm was shown in Fig. S1. The blank electrolyte was synthesized 1 mol L âˆ’1 lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) in a 1:1 V/V a solution of 1,2-dimethoxyethane and 1,3-DOL containing LiNO3 (2 wt.%). The chemical reaction of sulfur and the appropriated number of Li2S was stirred at 60 â„ƒ for 24 h forming 1 mol L âˆ’1 Li2S6 catholyte in the blank electrolyte. The proportion of the NCFs collectors were adjusted to keep the sulfur contents in all the complex cathodes around 73.3 wt%. The mass of sulfur was defined by ms=Ms/A=(VÃ—MÃ—nÃ—Mr)/A. Where, ms was loading of sulfur (mg cm âˆ’2 ), Ms was mass of sulfur for each electrode (mg), A was the area of NCFs electrode (A = 1.13 cm âˆ’2 for the disc in 12 mm diameter), V was the volume of added catholyte (L), M was the mole concentration of lithium polysulfides Li2Sn (n = 6) (M: molÂ·L âˆ’1 ), Mr was relative molecular mass of sulfur (32 gÂ·mol âˆ’1 ). 24.7 Î¼L Li2S6 catholyte equal to 4.74 mg of sulfur and the final areal sulfur loading of the electrode was determined about 4.19 mgÂ·cm âˆ’2 . Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of NCFs 2.2 Materials characterization XRD measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer using Cu KÎ± radiation and scanned in the range of 10Âº-80Âº. The Raman spectra were acquired on a Renishaw Raman Invia spectrometer. The electronic conductivity of NCFs membranes was characterized four point probe tester. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Multilab 2000) analysis of the NCFs was using a monochromatic Al KÎ± X-ray source. The morphology of the composites was measured by scanning electron microscopy (JEO-JSM-7800F) and transmission electron microscopy (TENCAI G2F30). Shan-shan Yao et al. / New Carbon Materials, 2021, 36(3): 606-615 2.3 Electrochemical measurement An electrode comprising NCFs was evaluated as cathode using 2032 coin cells with a Celagard 2400 membrane as the separator. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) was measured on the CHI600E electrochemical workstation in a range of 1.7âˆ’2.8 V. A VMP2 multi-channel potentiostat was used to perform electrochemical impedance tests a frequency range of 0.01-10 mHz. Cycling performance and rate capability tests were performed with LAND 2001A battery testers, setting voltage from 1.7 V to 2.8 V. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of NCFs The pXRD patterns of NCFs in Fig. 2(a) present a broad peak at around 24.93Âº, corresponding to the (002) plane, a characteristic of the disordered carbon materials [31] . The lattice constants of the (002) peak calculated by the Bragg's law are shown in Table 1. With increase in carbonization temperature from 800, 900 to 1000 â„ƒ, the interlayer spacing decreases slightly from 0.358, 0.357 to 0.355 nm, which is always greater than that of graphite (0.336 nm) [32,33] . The Raman spectrum was measured to describe the graphitization of NCFs (Fig. 2(b). The Raman spectrum of NCFs possesses two well-known main peaks at 1,343 cm âˆ’1 (D-band) and 1567 cm âˆ’1 (G-band), which are related to sp 3 -hybridized carbon and sp 2 carbon-type, respectively [34,35] . As shown in Table 1, the ratio of IG/ID increased with the carbonization temperature and represented the transformation of disordered carbon into graphitic carbon during the carbonization process. However, the NCFs-1000 membrane shows the lower electronic conductivity, which is attributed to the fracture of NCFs with ahigher carbonization temperature and they cannot maintain the continuity [36] . Fig. S2 presents the adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore-sized distribution of composite membrane. Table 1 shows the data. The specific surface area is 83.67, 142.82 and 130.6 m 2 Â·g âˆ’1 for NCFs-800, NCFs-900 and NCFs-1000, respectively, with pore volume of 0.07, 0.18 and 0.27 cm 3 g âˆ’1 . The pore structure of NCFs-900 has effectively permeating the electrolyte and thus lithium ions to diffuse rapidly. The XPS measurement spectra of NCFs is shown in Fig. 2(c), and the presence of 3 distinct peaks in NCFs at 284.0, 399.5 and 530.6 eV can be attributed to C 1s, N 1s and O 1s, respectively. All 3 NCFs show two N 1s peaks and can be deconvoluted into 3 peaks at 398.2, 400.7 and 401.9 eV, which are attributed to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N, respectively (Fig. 2(d-f)). Table 2 presents the nitrogen contents analysis results for NCFs. The nitrogen contents decrease with increasing carbonization temperature. It is notable that the relative amount of pyrrolic-N also decreases with increases carbonization temperature, which indicates that pyrrolic-N has been chemically transformed into other nitrogen species, such as pyridinic-N and other N-O, etc [37] . The electrochemical performance, especially for rate performance and electronic/ionic conductivity, could be improved by the existence of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N structures [38,39] . Fig. 2(g-i) show the HRTEM images of NCFs. Turbostratic structure and rough fiber surface are observable, indicating the presence of amorphous structure and structural defects which are favorable for Li + diffusion from various orientations and can provide sufficient contact area between active materials and the electrolyte.

Fig. 3(a) shows the SEM image of the PAN nanofibers and the average diameter is about 450 nm, which are shrinked after carbonization. Fig. 3(b-d) shows the typical SEM images of NCFs, which are carbonized at 800, 900 and 1000 â„ƒ with the precursor PAN nanofibers. The morphology of the NCFs-800, NCFs-900 and NCFs-1000 is similar to the PAN nanofibers with the average diameters at about 270, 200 and 170 nm, respectively. The diameter of NCFs was decreased with increasing the carbonization temperature due to the large amount of small organic molecules releasing during higher carbonization temperature [40,41] . Nevertheless, the fracture of NCFs-1000 with a higher carbonization temperature and cannot maintain the continuity, which reduces the electrochemical properties in electrodes. The cross section of NCFs-900 membrane was about 100 Î¼m. This three-dimensional structure of NCFs could be performed as free-standing electrode materials. Fig. 3 SEM images of (a) PAN nanofibers; (b) NCFs-800; (c) NCFs-900 and (d) NCFs-1000; (e) Cross section of NCFs-900. 3.2 Electrochemical behaviors of NCFs Electrochemical performances of Li-S cells with NCFs@Li2S6 were then investigated by CV (Fig. 4(a)). The NCFs@Li2S6 composite electrodes were at the first circulated at 0.05 C, and then the cells were in the activation and fully charged at 0.2 C. As depicted in Fig. 4(a), there are two reduction peaks and two oxidation peaks in the CV curves [42] . Two reduction peaks at 2.29âˆ’2.31 V and 1.97âˆ’2.01 V, respectively, correspond to the transformation of long-chain polysulfide (Li2Sn, 4 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 8) and further to Li2S2/Li2S [43,44] . During the following charge, two overlapping anodic peaks were observed around 2.36 and 2.42 V are attributed to the oxidation of solid Li2S2/Li2S to soluble polysulfides finally to elemental sulfur [45] . Obviously, there are almost same CV curves of three cells. While the NCFs-900@Li2S6 possesses a higher current intensity, which suggest an increase in capacity. Additionally, the NCFs-900 can lower the polarization (Î”V = 0.40 V) and enhance the electrochemical reaction kinetics. In Fig. 4(b) shows the discharge curves of three kinds of electrodes, which comprises of three well-defined discharge plateaus and are in agreement with the CV curves. To further analyze the excellent capacity characteristics, the values of Qa (the capacity of the higher discharge plateau), Qb (the capacity of the lower discharge plateau) and the ratio of Qb / Qa are presented [46,47] . NCFs-900@Li2S6 electrode has the highest Qb/Qa (2.42) than NCFs-800@Li2S6 (2.37) and NCFs-1000@Li2S6 (2.25) electrodes, indicating that NCFs-900 contributes to accelerate the reactions kinetic. The rate performance of Li-S cells with NCFs@Li2S6 (correspond sulfur loading: 4.19 mgÂ·cm âˆ’2 ) is shown in Fig. 4(c). For the cell with NCFs-900@Li2S6 electrode, it achieves discharge capacities of 947, 875, 773, 721 and 623 mAhÂ·g âˆ’1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively. And when the rate returns to 0.1 C, the capacity was recovered to 923 mAhÂ·g âˆ’1 , suggesting the excellent stability of the NCFs-900@Li2S6 electrode. Cycling performances and coulombic efficiency were tested at 0.2 C (Fig. 4(d)). NCFs-900@Li2S6 electrode exhibits a capacity of 875 mAhÂ·g âˆ’1 and maintains at 707 mAhÂ·g âˆ’1 at 0.2 C over 250 cycles. While, the capacities of NCFs-800@Li2S6 and NCFs-1000@Li2S6 electrodes faded to 531 and 394 mAhÂ·g âˆ’1 , respectively. In addition, the Coulombic efficiency of NCFs-900@Li2S6 electrode is almost 98.55% over the entire cycling. Even at 1 C (Fig. S3), the capacity retention of NCFs-900@Li2S6 electrode reaches 81.53% after 150 cycles, behaving improved cycling stability. Among all 3 NCFs, NCFs-900 displays the excellent electrochemical performance, mainly owing to its high conductivity (12.19 sÂ·cm âˆ’1 ) and large surface area (142.82 m 2 Â·g âˆ’1 ), which is greater than those of NCFs-800 (0.26 SÂ·cm âˆ’1 ; 83.67 m 2 Â·g âˆ’1 ) and NCFs-1000 (2.78 SÂ·cm âˆ’1 ; 130.60 m 2 Â·g âˆ’1 ), respectively. Especially, the coexistence of both pyridinc-N and gaphitic-N in the NCFs-900 has been used to enhance the electrochemical performance [48,49] . The N-doped carbon hosts have attracted great attention for sulfur cathodes because these matrices not only enhance the conductivity of sulfur but also increase the Shan-shan Yao et al. / New Carbon Materials, 2021, 36(3): 606-615 interaction of polar N sites and anchor polysulfides, which can alleviate polysulfides shuttling through physical and chemical confinement using the porous structure and chemisorption. Similar result has also been found by Guo and Nazar et al. in their study on N-doped carbon materials in Li-S batteries [50,51] . Therefore, good electrochemical properties of NCFs can be obtained by optimizing the thermal treatment conditions, such as treatment temperature and time, and balancing the structural parameters such as pore structure of unique nanofibers, etc [52] . Generally, the superior electrochemical performance of NCFs-900 is also attributed to the unique nanofibrou structure with appropriate surface area. As illustrated in Fig. 4 (e), first of all, the unique nanofibrous carbon structure formed by continuous N-CNFs ensures an efficient and uninterrupted electron transport. Secondly, the doping nitrogen in NCFs was to be polarized and more active in anchoring polysulfides. Based on the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and the mesoporous conductive pathway, the as-fabricated NCFs-900 has displayed excellent electrochemical performance. Fig. 4 Electrochemical performances of NCFs@Li2S6 composite electrodes: (a) CV profiles at 0.1 mV s âˆ’1 between 1.7-2.8 V; (b) Discharge profiles at 0.2 C; (c) Rate performances of NCFs@Li2S6 composite electrodes at various current densities from 0.1 to 2 C; (d) Long cycling performance of NCFs@Li2S6 composite electrodes at 0.2 C; (e) Schematic of Li2S6 adsorption in the NCFs. Fig. 5(a) is the Nyquist plots of the cells with NCFs@Li2S6 composite electrodes. The EIS plots after fitting based on the equivalent circuit of the composite electrodes consist of a high-frequency semicircle and an inclined line at low-frequency region. Moreover, the kinetic values of the two electrodes are listed in Table S1. Obviously, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the cell using NCFs-900 (23.53 Î©) is the lower than that of the cell using NCFs-800 (27.28 Î©). It is important to note that although the NCFs-1000 has the lowest Rct (20.02 Î©), which is due to a higher electronic conductivity. However, the fracture of NCFs-1000 caused unstable structure could reduce the migration of lithium ions. A linear relationship between the resistance in real part and angular velocity to invers square root during the low-frequency region is also displayed in Fig. 5(b) [53,54] . The DLi+ values according to the Equation S1 and S2 are 8.36 Ã—10 âˆ’10 , 4.08Ã—10 âˆ’9 and 3.11Ã—10 âˆ’10 cm 2 Â·s âˆ’1 for NCFs-800@Li2S6, NCFs-900@Li2S6 and NCFs-1000@Li2S6 composite electrode, which further proved as above results. To further understand the effect of NCFs on polysulfides, XPS and TEM were used to analyze the composition and morphologies of the cycled electrode. Fig. S4 shows the high resolution spectrum of S2p, indicating that the binding energy of 162.7 eV and 164.3 eV represents Liâ€“S and Sâ€“S bond, and Fig. 5 (a) EIS of the Li-S batteries with NCFs@Li2S6 electrode; (b) The dependence of Zre on the reciprocal square root of the frequency Ï‰-0.5 in the low frequency region for composite electrodes. the binding energy of 166.1 eV and 169.2 eV corresponding to SO3 2- and Sâ€“O. In fact, the former Li-S bond and S-S bond are attributed to elemental sulfur and deposition of Li2S. The presence of latter SO3 2- and Sâ€“O bond are due to sulfate and the decomposition of the electrolyte used to impregnate the electrode during charging and discharging [55,56] . Additionally, the NCFs after cycling were characterized by HRTEM. Due to the high vacuum and high voltage HRTEM testing environment and the generation of high temperature on the surface as the electrons pass through the sample, the deposited products (such as sulfur or polysulfide species) were sublimated. A video was performed to exhibit the changing of Shan-shan Yao et al. / New Carbon Materials, 2021, 36(3): 606-615 Fig. 6 TEM images of NCFs-900 at different electron irradiation times: (a) 0 s; (b) 5 s; (c) 10 s and (d) 15 s; (e) The corresponding elemental mapping images of NCFs-900@Li2S6 electrode at charge state after 250 cycles. sublimation process as shown in supplementary material. Fig. 6(a-d) shows several screen shots of abovementioned video at different times, respectively. Compared with the smooth surface of pristine NCFs (Fig. S5), the deposited products on the NCFs gradually disappeared because of the electrons irradiation, which indicate that the NCFs have capability of anchoring polysulfides and improving the utilization of active material. Fig. 6(e) is an EDS elemental mapping of NCFs that shows the homogenous distribution of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. 4 Conclusion In summary, the fibrous NCFs membrane was prepared by a combined electrospinning/carbonization technique. The result indicated that carbonization processes of PAN webs influenced the chemical and morphological characteristics as well as the thermal properties according to the pyrolysis temperature. The continuous conducting framework of NCFs is connected to the current collector and contained Li2S6 catholyte solution for Li-S batteries. Especially for NCFs-900, it shows the initial discharge capacity of 875 mAhÂ·g âˆ’1 with 4.19 mgÂ·cm âˆ’2 sulfur loading and retains 707 mAhÂ·g âˆ’1 at 0.2 C over 250 cycles. Even at high current density of 1 C, the capacity retention of electrode reaches 81.53% after 150 cycles, which behaving improvement cycling stability. It may be suggested that appropriate control of carbonization processes probably plays a role in monitoring the characteristics of NCFs for energy storage applications.

Specifically, bismuth nitrate [Bi(NO3)3·5H2O] (98.0 %), sodium acetate [NaCOOCH3·3H2O] (99.0 %) and strontium acetate hemihydrate [Sr(COOCH3)2·0.5H2O] were dissolved in anhydride acetic acid by magnetic stirring according to stoichiometric ratio, in which the excess of bismuth and sodium was about 5 mol% to compensate for the volatilization of elements during high temperature annealing. Subsequently, a quantitative amount of 2-methoxy ethanol [C2H4O2] (99.8 %), titanium n-butanol [Ti(OC4H9)4] (99.0 %) and acetylacetone [C5H8O2] (99.0 %) were sequentially added to the above solution and stirred at room temperature for 5 h, and the A precursor solution were obtained after aging for 24 h. In addition, a small amount of Mn additive (2 mol %) was added to suppress the leakage current. The B precursor solution can be obtained by a similar process. 2.2 Film deposition The solutions A and B were deposited on the (001) LaNiO3/Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si (LNO) substrate using a spin coating process at 4000 rotation per minute (rpm) for 30 s according to the relevant design (BAA, ABA, AAB).

Moreover, The details of the materials used for the photocatalytic degradation process were further provided in Table SI. 5.\nInstruments\nAll reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from commercial sources without further purification. To identify and analyze the composition of the sample, a combination of techniques was used. One of these techniques involved analyzing the sample’s composition using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Philips PW1730 instrument. The determination of surface area and pore size distribution was carried out using the BET multilayer nitrogen adsorption method. This conventional volumetric technique was performed on a BET BELSORP Mini II instrument. An FTIR Thermo Avatar spectrometer was utilized to collect the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic data, covering the wavelength range of 400–4000 cm−1. The morphology of the materials was evaluated using both the scanning electron microscope (SEM) VEGA3 and the transmission electron microscope (TEM) Philips EM 208S. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Shimadzu TGA-50, operating under an argon atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/Vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the maximum absorbance wavelengths and determine the concentrations of dyes in the aqueous solutions. The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–Vis DRS) were obtained using a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. To determine the elemental states, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB Xi + XPS spectrometer.\nPreparation of TCPP-H2\nA mixture of 120 mL acetic acid/60 mL nitrobenzene (2:1) as the solvent was refluxed for 1 h at 150 °C followed by the addition of 1.343 g 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (0.01 mol) (Scheme 1). After a few min, 0.6 mL of as-distilled pyrrole was added dropwise. Reflux continued for 1 h before cooling the mixture to ambient temperature. The synthesis process was completed by storing the mixture in a dark, sealed container for three consecutive nights. Subsequently, the resulting precipitate was collected and thoroughly washed with ethanol. Finally, the precipitate was dried at 60 °C. The purple sediment of TCPP-H2 with a yield of 25% was obtained [25].\nScheme 1\nPreparation of TCPP-H2\nFull size image\nUV–Vis in DMF: λmax (nm): 418 (Soret), 507, 551, 584, and 643 (Q-bands).

The resulting mixture was refluxed at 150 °C for 8 h. Subsequently, the precipitate was collected and washed with distilled water. The obtained precipitate was then dissolved in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and then precipitated by adding 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). The resulting product was dissolved in ethanol (C2H6O), and the solvent was removed through evaporation and then dried in an oven at 60 °C. The final product obtained was Mn(III) meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin chloride (TCPP-Mn) (C48H28MnNO8Cl), which appeared as a dark green powder and was obtained with a yield of 94% [84].\nScheme 2\nPreparation of TCPP-H2\nFull size image\nUV–Vis in DMF: λmax (nm): 468 (Soret), 577 and 602 (Q-bands).

Five nanomaterials of CoxZn100 − x-(TCPP-Mn) MOFs, with adjusted Co to Zn ratios, were produced by varying the molar ratio of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% Zn2+) in the reaction mixture during synthesis. In the first ratio, Zn(NO3)2∙6H2O (5.0 mg) (0.017 mmol), Mn-TCPP (5.0 mg) (0.005 mmol), and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (75 μL) were dissolved in 2 mL of DMF in a 4-mL pyrex vial ultrasonically. The mixture was heated in a 150 °C oven for 24 h. The product was collected after centrifugation and washing, yielding crystals with a dark, rod-like morphology. Scheme S1 provides the synthesis pathway. For the other ratios, Co(NO3)2∙6H2O was replaced with a relative content of Zn(NO3)2∙6H2O, and the procedure was followed as previously mentioned. The yield of selected MM-MOF (Zn75%/Co25% (TCPP-Mn)) has been calculated as 61%, and it is referenced in Table S4 alongside the yields of other synthetic MOFs.

XRD (2θ˚): 7.5° (110), 20° (002), 30° (111), 40° (200), 50° (220), the average size of the crystals is approximately 10 nm.\nSynthesis of TCPP-based MOF\nAll the procedures mentioned above for synthesizing (TCPP-Mn)-based MOF were also conducted for metal-free TCPP-based MOF (Scheme 3). However, in this case, TCPP was substituted with an equimolar amount of TCPP-Mn.\nScheme 3\nSynthesis of TCPP-based MOFs\nFull size image\nExperimental setup for photocatalysis\nIn this study, we employed a photocatalytic degradation process to investigate the breakdown of 1,5-DHN (2 × 10−4 M) in acetonitrile solution using a metal–organic framework (MOF) catalyst (Scheme 4). We added a solution of 6 mg MOF to 50 mL of acetonitrile containing 1,5-DHN, followed by degassing the solution three times and then adding pure oxygen (O2). The reaction was initiated by illuminating the solution with a 300-W xenon lamp. At specific time intervals, we sampled 2 mL of the reaction solution for analysis. The reaction yields were determined by calculating the absorption of Juglone in the UV–Vis spectra. The schematic diagram depicting the photodegradation process is provided in Scheme 5.\nScheme 4\nSynthesis of TCPP-based MM-MOFs\nFull size image\nScheme 5\nPhotodegradation of 1,5-DHN to Juglone [85]\nFull size image\nThe photo-oxidation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,5-DHN) leads to the formation of 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione (Juglone). UV–Vis spectra were employed to monitor the reaction progress. Absorption of 1,5-DHN occurs at 298 nm, while absorption of Juglone occurs at 420 nm. As the reaction proceeds, the absorption of 1,5-DHN decreases, while the absorption of Juglone increases. Previous studies have indicated that the degradation reaction of 1,5-DHN in the photocatalytic process follows quasi-first-order kinetics. This is supported by the relationship between the natural logarithm of the concentration ratio (Ln Ct/Co) and time. The slope of this linear relationship, denoted as kobs, represents the observed reaction rate. Additionally, the half-life of the reaction was calculated \\(\\left({\\text{t}}_{1/2}= \\frac{Ln 2}{K} = \\frac{0.693}{0.7246} = 0.956\\right)\\).\nThe photodegradation experiments were conducted at room temperature, focusing on 1,5-DHN as the analyte (Scheme 6). Parameters such as contact time, catalyst concentration, light source, solvent, and oxidant were optimized. The specified amount of 1,5-DHN was dissolved in the solvent to prepare 2 × 10−4 M solutions. Various catalysts were added to these solutions, followed by different contact times. The resulting nanocomposites were isolated via centrifugation, and the concentration of the remaining 1,5-DHN in the solution was determined using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer.\nScheme 6\nPhotocatalytic degradation process\nFull size image", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "TCPP-H2", "Syns_method": "solvent reflux and aging", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "4-carboxybenzaldehyde", "amount": "1.343 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "pyrrole", "amount": "0.6 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "CH3COOH", "amount": "120 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "nitrobenzene", "amount": "60 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "reflux", "parameters": {"temperature": "150 °C", "time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "age", "parameters": {"time": "3 days"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "TCPP-Mn", "Syns_method": "solution reflux and precipitation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "MnCl2·4H2O", "amount": "0.82 mmol"}, "prc2": {"name": "H2TCPP", "amount": "0.26 mmol"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C3H7NO", "amount": "80 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "reflux", "parameters": {"temperature": "150 °C", "time": "8 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "precipitation"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dissolve", "parameters": {"reagent": "NaOH", "amount": "0.1 M"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "precipitation", "parameters": {"reagent": "HCl", "amount": "1 M"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "CoxZn100−x-(TCPP-Mn) MOFs", "Syns_method": "solvent diffusion synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "5.0 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "TCPP-Mn", "amount": "5.0 mg"}, "prc3": {"name": "TFA", "amount": "75 µL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C3H7NO", "amount": "2 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "150 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "centrifuge"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash"}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "TCPP-based MOF", "Syns_method": "solvent diffusion synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "5.0 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "TCPP", "amount": "5.0 mg"}, "prc3": {"name": "TFA", "amount": "75 µL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C3H7NO", "amount": "2 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "150 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "centrifuge"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash"}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "The spent LiFePO4 (S-LFP) batteries were obtained from Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co., Ltd (Zhejiang, China), and the tailored LiFePO4 electrode of 2 × 2 cm was obtained via further manual disassembly and clipping, in which the loaded active substance was 0.1481 g. According to the measurement of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; IRIS Intrepid XSP, Thermo Electron Corp.), the main chemical elemental content is well-understood (Table 1). The lithium sulfate (99.5% Li2SO4, A.R.) used in this work was of analytical grade.\nThe lithiation experiments were conducted in a three-electrode electrolytic cell equipped with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and platinum-mesh auxiliary electrode of 2 × 2 cm to detect the changes in the current and voltage. The detailed experimental procedures are as follows: the spent LiFePO4 electrode with a constant size of 2 × 2 cm was fixed in an electrode clamp containing a platinum conductor. Then, the electrode clamp comprising the spent LiFePO4 electrode was assembled with the reference electrode and auxiliary electrode into a three-electrode electrolytic cell. The position of the spent LiFePO4 electrode was equal to that of the auxiliary electrode, and the Li2SO4 electrolyte was higher than the spent LiFePO4 electrode. The assembled three-electrode device was maintained at rest for 2 h without the output current, and the obtained lithium-deficiency LiFePO4 is labeled as R-LFP. Next, a constant reverse current supplied by an electrochemical workstation (SP-300) was output when the spent LiFePO4 electrode is regarded as the anode, facilitating the spent LiFePO4 electrode to capture electrons. To survey the effect of the output current on regenerated results, targeted electrically-driven lithiation experiments with different current magnitudes, including 0.5 mA, 1 mA, 2 mA, and 5 mA, were carried out. The lithiation of the LiFePO4 electrode after discharging (obtaining electron) was washed with deionized water and dried for 6 h at 80 °C. Finally, the regenerated LiFePO4 electrode was sintered at 500 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere. Simple milling and screening through a 200-mesh were conducted to separate the regenerated LiFePO4 and Al foil. The final regenerated LiFePO4 treated by the targeted output current was denoted as C-LFP.\nThe voltage change was measured using an electrochemical workstation (SP-300). The LiFePO4 electrode was dissolved by aqua regia (HNO3 : HCl = 1 : 3), and the solution was diluted to a suitable concentration. All elements, including Li, Fe, P, and Al, were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; IRIS Intrepid XSP, Thermo Electron Corp.). The phase and component of LiFePO4 were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, TTR III, Rigaku, Japan) equipped with a copper target at 18 kW. The microstructure and surface topography of LiFePO4 was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (XL30 ESEM-TMP Philips-FEI, Netherlands) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) at an accelerating voltage of 10–20 kV. The crystal structure analysis was performed using Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM, Japan, JEOL2100F, 200 kV). The study of the elemental valence state was conducted using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Escalab 250xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).\nFor C-LFP composites, the cathode was prepared with a suspension including C-LFP powder of 80 wt%, acetylene black 10 wt%, and polyvinylidene fluoride 10 wt%. Then, the proper amount of N-menthyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was introduced into the above-mixed material, forming a homogeneous slurry, which was applied evenly onto the Al foil current collector. Then, the processed Al foil was dried at 90 °C for 6 h and cut into fixed-sized circles. The 2032-coin cells were assembled in a glove box with Air-filled (Mikrouna, Super1220/750/900, H2O < 0.01 ppm; O2 < 0.01 ppm).

The development of the fast, simple, and facile route for the synthesis of novel CeO2@TiO2 core-shell nanocomposite particles was suggested. An approach to increase the shell thickness of titania is to increase the concentration of the precursor of titania, but it also observed the formation of a small amount of independent titania clusters. It is shown that an increase in the titania content leads to the formation of a larger proportion of the rutile phase and a decrease in the proportion of metastable anatase and brookite, while reducing the particle size of the initial ceria core and the specific surface area due to the contact of titania shells, caused by the closer connections between nanoparticles.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "CeO2@TiO2", "application": "core-shell nanocomposite particles", "props": {}}}}

Since LTO is a zero-strain insertion electrode that does not change in thickness during lithium insertion/extraction reactions [40,41], the change in the thickness of the Li/LTO cell should be equal to that of the Li-metal electrode. The LTO electrode consisted of 88 wt% LTO, 6 wt% acetylene black, and 6 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride. The LTO electrode area was 2 cm2 (16.0-mm diameter). The Li-metal electrode was prepared by pressing a lithium foil rolled on a lithium chip cut out from a lithium rod (>99%, Rare Metallic Co., Ltd., Japan) onto a stainless steel plate. The Li-metal electrode thickness was ∼100 μm. The electrolyte used was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in an ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (3/7 by volume) solution (Kishida Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan). The amount of the electrolyte was 0.1 mL. 2.2 Dilatometric measurement of Li/LTO cell A high-precision dilatometer [40] (Fig. S1) was used to monitor changes in Li/LTO cell thickness during the cycle test at a constant current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. It consists of a main body (cylindrical sidewall and circular plate) and a spindle 65 mm high and 20 mm in diameter. The spindle contacts to the cell (the bottom of the spindle covers the entire electrode) and moves upward and downward in accordance with the change in cell thickness. The cell is pressurised by means of a spring, one end of which is attached to the inside wall and the other end to the spindle. A previous study [30] indicated that the cycleability of a Li metal electrode strongly depends on the pressure applied to the cell; specifically, higher pressures lead to better cycleability. Therefore, the maximum pressure (∼300 kPa) was applied to the cell to investigate the dimensional stability of the Li-metal electrode under nearly ideal conditions. The displacement of the spindle was directly monitored by a transducer sensor (AT2-51, Keyence) tightly fitted to the body, which produces an electrical signal proportional to the amount of displacement. This electrical signal was amplified by an amplifier unit (AT2-301, Keyence). The range of displacement that could be recorded was ±0.5 mm, corresponding to ±5 V in voltage output with a zero-shift allowance of ±25 mV. The system was calibrated using stainless steel plates of various thicknesses.

However, current photocatalysts can be expensive, complex, and hazardous to synthesize. This research is driven by the development of a simple and economical approach of sol-gel for the synthesis of zirconium dioxide (ZrO2)/ titanium dioxide (TiO2) composites, aimed at enhancing their photocatalytic performance. The synthesized samples were characterized thoroughly. Electron microscope images displayed a porous worm-like morphology for the synthesized composites. The structural analysis confirmed that the composite samples contained ZrO2/TiO2 with TiO2 had grown solely in the anatase phase. The mechanisms of electron-hole recombination and separation of charge carriers were discussed using photoluminescence (PL). The catalytic properties of the prepared samples were studied by methylene blue (MB) under ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 360 nm. By adding 25 mg of TiO2 in 50 mg ZrO2 (sample ZT3), the degradation rate of MB dye reached 63% in 80 min.

The membranes were subsequently employed to extract cobalt ions from simulated radioactive wastewater. The findings showed that the best performance of the membrane was obtained with a 3 % MOF content (3%UiO-66-Lys/PAN). Specifically, the pure water flux (PWF) of the 3 % UiO-66-Lys/PAN membrane reached 872 L m−2 h−1 with a cobalt ion retention of 45.4 %. In addition, adsorption experiments indicated that the NFMs had a theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of 41.4 mg/g for cobalt ions.

Indium nitrate hydrate (99.99 % metals basis) was supplied by Shanghai Aladdin reagent company. H3TATAB ligand (98 %, AR) was purchased from Shanghai CHEMSOON Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. All solvents including DMA, DMF, CH2Cl2, CH3CN, CHCl3, MeOH and EtOH were obtained from Luoyang Chemical Reagent Factory. Nitric acid (HNO3, 65–68 %) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. A Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer was used to collect powder X-ray diffraction data in the 2theta range of 3-45°. Thermogravimetric analyse (TGA) curve was recorded on the Netzsch STA 449C thermal analyser in the N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. N2 (77 K), C2H2 and CO2 (273 and 298 K) sorption isotherms were collected on a Belsorp-max II automated volumetric sorption analyzer. Before the gas sorption studies, 200 mg of the as-prepared samples were soaked in fresh MeOH for two days, which were then exchanged with fresh CH2Cl2 for another two days. The solvent-exchanged samples were activated at 80 °C under dynamic vacuum for 12 h to obtain the activated samples. The temperature for gas sorption experiments was controlled by liquid nitrogen bath (77 K) and EtOH bath (273 K and 298 K). The sensing experiments were carried out on a Hitachi F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. 2.2 Synthesis of [In3(OH)3(TATAB)2](DMA)8(CH3CN)6(H2O)2 (1) To a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave was added a mixture of In(NO3)3·6H2O (0.3 mmol, 0.1300 g), H3TATAB (0.15 mmol, 0.0750 g), DMF (4 mL), CH3CN (1.5 mL) and H2O (1 mL). The mixture was stirred in the air for 30 min, then HNO3 (50 μL, 1 M, aq) was injected into the mixture. The autoclave was kept at 120 °C for 30 h under autogenous pressure, which was then cooled to room temperature within a time of 60 h. Colorless block crystals were obtained at the bottom of the reactor, which was washed with DMF and EtOH for three times and left in the air for drying. Yield: 29.3 % (68.7 mg) based on the H3TATAB ligand used. Elemental analyses calculated for C92H133In3N26O25 (1): C: 47.07 %, H: 5.71 %, N: 15.51 %; experimental for 1: C: 46.92 %, H: 5.58 %, N: 15.79 %. FT-IR spectrum of 1 was provided in Fig. S1 in the supporting information. 2.3 Crystal structure determination The single crystal sample of 1 with smooth surface and regular shape was carefully screened with the help of microscope which was used in the single crystal X-ray diffraction study. An Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur Eos Gemini diffractometer with graphite monochromated CuKα radiation at room temperature was employed to gather the reflecting data. The data collection and reduction were performed using the CrysAlisPro software (Version 1.171.35.21), and empirical absorption correction was done by spherical harmonics implemented in SCALE3 ABSPACK scaling algorithm. The initial electron density diagram was obtained via the olex2. solve program imbedded in the OLEX2 software and then refined by the SHELXL software [27]. All H atoms are refined based on the riding model and all non-H atoms are refined anisotropically. The contribution of disordered solvents were removed by the SQUEEZE operation embedded in the PLATON software to lower the R1 and wR2 values of the CIF file refined [28]. The detailed crystal parameters and refinement indexes were listed in Table 1 . 2.4 Luminescence sensing experiments The air-dried crystalline samples (5 mg) was ﬁnely ground and dispersed in water (1 mg in 1.8 mL H2O) under the condition of ultrasonication for 30 min to obtain the stock solution. Then different amounts of NACs such as TNT, TNP, 4-NT, 2-NT, 3-NT, 2,6-DNT, 4-DNT and NB (1 mM in EtOH) were gradually added into the about stock solution. After standing for 10 s, the fluorescence date was immediately recorded at room temperature. 2.5 DFT calculations and molecular simulations All the calculations were carried out using the Materials Studio software (version: 2020). We used the CIF file of 1 as the structural model directly because there are no obvious changes in the PXRD patterns after activation and TNP detection. After the introduction of CIF file of 1, its space group was set to P-1 to remove the disordered H atoms on -OH groups to get an electrically neutral framework whose atomic charges were then calculated using the QEq method based on the parameter set of QEq_charged 1.1. A 1 × 1 × 2 supercell was used in the simulation to ensure the least cell axis is larger than the twice of the cutoff distance. The molecules of C2H2 and CO2 were geometrically optimized using the DMOL3 package based on the function of GGA-PBE in which the ESP charges were also obtained. The Fixed pressure task based on the Metropolis method was used to study loading number of C2H2 and CO2 at 298 K and 101 KPa, in which the equilibration steps and Production steps was both set to 5 × 107. The forcefield was set to UFF for C2H2 while TraPPe for CO2, and the cutoff distance was set to 15 Å. Ewald and atom-based simulation method was used to describe the electrostatic and van der Waals interaction, respectively. The preferential binding sites for C2H2 and CO2 in 1a at beginning loading were calculated using the Locate task in the sorption model based on the same forcefield and charge used above. The framework-gas binding energy was evaluated using the DMOL3 package based on the function of GGA-PBE, which was calculated based on the following equation: Ebinding = Eframework + gas-Eframework-Egas. The HOMO-LUMO energy levers were derived from the DMOL3 package based on the function of GGA-PBE. The structures of ligand and NACs were drawn manually and then subjected to the geometry optimization task, in which quality was set to fine and core treatment was set to all electron. The structure of TNP@1 was obtained using the geometry optimization task in the Forcite model. During the calculation, fractional position of 1 was fixed because the PXRD patterns of 1 after TNP detection are similar with those of the prepared sample. The calculation quality was set to fine and Forcefield was set to Dreiding which could well describe the H-bond interactions between the framework and guests. The charges were derived from Qeq and Cutoff distance was set to 12.5 Å.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "[In3(OH)3(TATAB)2](DMA)8(CH3CN)6(H2O)2", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "In(NO3)3·6H2O", "amount": "0.1300 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "H3TATAB", "amount": "0.0750 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "HNO3", "amount": "50 μL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C3H7NO", "amount": "4 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "C2H3N", "amount": "1.5 mL"}, "sov3": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "1 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "30 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "cool", "parameters": {"time": "60 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "C3H7NO"}, {"name": "C2H5OH"}], "times": "3 times"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"method": "air drying"}}}}}}}

Metallic magnesium (50 mesh), aluminum trichloride, vanadium(V) oxide, and 1-chlorobutane are Aldrich reagents grade. 1-chlorobutane is further purified by standard methods and stored under Argon on 4A molecular sieves to prevent moisture contamination. Anhydrous δ-MgCl2 salt is prepared by direct reaction of metallic magnesium with 1-chlorobutane under a strictly anhydrous atmosphere as described elsewhere [17–19]. Pyr14Cl/(AlCl3)1.5 (IL sample) is obtained by slowly mixing AlCl3 powder with the solid Pyr14Cl with a molar ratio 1:1.5 (Pyr14:Al). [Pyr14Cl/(AlCl3)1.5]/(δ-MgCl2)0.146 electrolyte is synthetized by reacting the desired stoichiometric amount of δ-MgCl2 salt with the IL by a smooth stirring. Electrolytes with a different composition ([Pyr14Cl/(AlCl3)1.5]/(δ-MgCl2)x, with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.146) are obtained by diluting the pristine homogeneous [Pyr14Cl/(AlCl3)1.5]/(δ-MgCl2)0.146 sample with appropriate amounts of IL. All reactions and manipulations of reagents and products are performed under a strictly pure Argon atmosphere, either using a Schlenk line setup, or directly inside a glove-box (H2O < 1 ppm, O2 < 1 ppm). 2.2 Composition, structure, and interactions The chemical compositions of the electrolytes and of the Al:Mg electrodeposited alloy are determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission analyses (ICP SPECTRO Arcos EOP). FT-FIR spectra are recorded in transmission on a Nicolet FT-IR Nexus spectrometer in the range between 680 and 50 cm- 1 by sandwiching each sample between two hermetically closed polyethylene windows. FT-Raman studies are performed using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 in the Raman shift with a laser excitation line at 632 nm. Spectra are collected with the samples sealed in glass tubes filled with argon. 2.3 Electrochemical tests The temperature dependent total conductivity is determined by means of broadband electrical spectroscopy (BES) technique, using a Novocontrol Alpha-A Analyzer. The measurements are carried out from -100 to 150 °C every 10 °C, with an accuracy greater than ±0.2 °C, and in the frequency range between 30 mHz and 10 MHz. Samples are sandwiched between two circular platinum electrodes with a diameter of 13 mm and hermetically sealed inside a Teflon cell. An optical fiber (d = 0.126 mm) is inserted between the two electrodes in order to avoid short circuits. An inert atmosphere is maintained for the whole duration of the test. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles are collected using a VSP Bio-Logic potentiostat/Galvanostat instrumentation operating at room temperature. Mg deposition/stripping measurements are obtained using a Pt working electrode (WE) and both Mg counter (CE) and reference (RE) electrodes. The average Coulombic efficiency is measured after an initial deposition of 0.040 C⋅cm- 2 followed by nine 0.008 C⋅cm- 2 cycles applying a current density of 0.4 mA⋅cm- 2. The final stripping step is cut off at +2.35 V vs. Mg/Mg2+ (anodic stability of the electrolyte). The electrochemical stability window (ESW) is determined by means of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV⋅s- 1. The ICP-AES measurement of the electrodeposited layer obtained using [Pyr14Cl/(AlCl3)1.5]/(δ-MgCl2)0.056 electrolyte (potentiostatic electrodeposition on a Pt electrode for 20 min at -0.3 V, T = 25 °C, deposited mass ca. 1.18 mg) is carried out after removing excess electrolyte from the Pt electrode by washing the electrode with freshly distilled dry toluene. The deposited layer is then removed from the Pt electrode by digestion with a diluted HNO3 solution. Before digestion, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the electrodeposited layer are acquired using a JEOL-Nikon NeoScope JCM-6000 Plus. An identical potentiostatic electrodeposition procedure is followed for the preparation of the sample used for the X-ray Photoelectron (XPS) studies. The XPS characterization is performed using a Specs EnviroESCA instrument, at an operating pressure of ca. 10- 6 mbar, using an AlKα excitation source (hυ = 1486.6 eV). High resolution spectra are acquired using the following parameters: 30 eV pass energy, 0.05 eV⋅step- 1, 0.1 s⋅step- 1. Binding energy values are corrected for charging assigning to the adventitious C 1s peak the value of 284.8 eV [21]. The long-term polarization measurement is performed using a Mg|[Pyr14Cl/(AlCl3)1.5]/(δ-MgCl2)0.056|Mg symmetrical cell and applying a current density of 0.1 mA⋅cm- 2 at 25 °C. Every cycle lasted 20 min. In order to avoid moisture and oxygen contaminations, material manipulations and all electrochemical studies are performed inside Ar-filled glove-boxes for the whole duration of the measurements. 2.4 Battery test The EL-CELL prototype device for battery test is assembled using a Mg metal anode, a vanadium oxide cathode, and the [Pyr14Cl/(AlCl3)1.5]/(δ-MgCl2)0.056 electrolyte. A glass fiber separator is used. The cathode mixture, consisting of a V2O5/C/PVDF blend (47:50:3 wt%), is deposited reaching an active material (V2O5) content of ca. 1.6 mg⋅cm- 2.

After stirring at 25 °C for 1 h, the mixed solution was transferred into a microwave hydrothermal synthesis system at 120 °C for 1.5 h. As the reactor was cooled down to ~ 25 °C, the mixture was washed five times with ethanol and then dried at 70 °C for 10 h. Zn/Ti-MOF with a molar ratio of Zn to Ti of 2% was prepared and labeled as Z/T-2%-MOF. The information of other molar ratios of Zn to Ti of Zn/Ti-MOF are listed in Table 1 . The C-doped ZnO/TiO2 composites with a molar ratio of Zn to Ti of 2% were obtained by the direct calcination of above Zn/Ti-MOF. After drying, 500 mg of the as-prepared Zn/Ti -MOF powders was transferred into a muffle furnace and reacted at 600 °C for 2 h under air (the heating rate: 5 °C/min). The C-doped ZnO/TiO2 composites with a molar ratio of Zn to Ti of 2% were obtained and labeled as Z/T-2%-600. For comparison, pure ZnO, TiO2, and C-doped ZnO/TiO2 composites with other molar ratios of Zn to Ti (Z/T-1%-600, Z/T-2%-600, Z/T-5%-600 and Z/T-10%-600) and other calcination temperatures (400, 500, 600 and 700 °C) were prepared in the same manner. The relevant molar ratios of Zn to Ti of the C-doped ZnO/TiO2 composites and their abbreviations are shown in Table 1 (X is calcination temperature and X = 400,500, 600 and 700) (see Table 2. ). 2.2 Photocatalytic degradation The photocatalytic performance of the C-doped ZnO/TiO2 composites was assessed via the removal of RhB under continuous simulated sunlight irradiation, and the experiments of dark adsorption were conducted. Exactly 50 mg of the as-prepared C-doped ZnO/TiO2 composites were dispersed to the photochemical reactor containing RhB solution (10 mg L−1, 100 mL) and kept in the dark for 30 min prior to the irradiations to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Then, the mixture was illuminated using a 200 W xenon lamp (CEL-LPH120) with the wavelength range of 320–1100 nm as a solar-simulated light source. Meanwhile, approximately 5 mL solution was taken out at regular intervals for the concentration detection of RhB. The RhB absorbance was obtained with a Shanghai UV-9000 absorption spectrophotometer at the maximum absorption wavelength of 554 nm.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Z/T-2%-MOF", "Syns_method": "microwave hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "4.545 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "H2BDC", "amount": "1.246 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "butyl titanate", "amount": "0.104 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C3H7NO", "amount": "100 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "CH3OH", "amount": "3 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "microwave hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "1.5 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "10 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Z/T-2%-600", "Syns_method": "calcination", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Z/T-2%-MOF", "amount": "500 mg"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "calcination", "parameters": {"temperature": "600 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}}}

Deionized (DI) water (resistivity: 18.3 MΩ·cm) was used for the preparation of all aqueous solutions.\nSynthesis of NiMoO4 nanorods on Ni foam\nNiMoO4 nanorods were synthesized on nickel foam through a hydrothermal method52. A piece of commercial Ni foam (2 × 5 cm2) was cleaned by ultrasonication with ethanol and DI water for several minutes, and the substrate was then transferred into a polyphenyl (PPL)-lined stainless-steel autoclave (100 ml) containing a homogenous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.04 M) and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.01 M) in 50 ml H2O. Afterward, the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 150 °C for 6 h. The sample was then taken out and washed with DI water and ethanol several times before being fully dried at 60 °C overnight under vacuum.\nSynthesis of NiMoN@NiFeN core-shell nanorods\nThe metal nitrides were synthesized by one-step nitridation of the NiMoO4 nanorods in a tube furnace. For the synthesis of NiMoN nanorods, a piece of NiMoO4/Ni foam (~1 cm2) was placed at the middle of a tube furnace and thermal nitridation was conducted at 500 °C under a flow of 120 standard cubic centimeters (sccm) NH3 and 30 sccm Ar for 1 h. The furnace was then automatically turned off and naturally cooled down to room temperature under Ar atmosphere. For the synthesis of NiMoN@NiFeN core-shell nanorods, a piece of NiMoO4/Ni foam (~1 cm2) was first soaked in a NiFe precursor ink, which was prepared by dissolving Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O with a mole ratio of 1:1 in DMF, and the NiMoO4/Ni foam coated with the NiFe precursor ink was then dried at ambient condition. The dried sample was subjected to thermal nitridation under the same conditions as for NiMoN. To study the effect of the NiFeN loading amount on the morphology of the core-shell nanorods, we prepared four different NiMoN@NiFeN core-shell nanorods with different loading amounts of NiFeN by controlling the concentration of Ni and Fe precursors. Specifically, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 g ml−1 concentrations of precursor ink were used. For comparison, pure NiFeN nanoparticles were also prepared on the Ni foam by replacing the NiMoO4/Ni foam with Ni foam. The concentration of precursor ink in this case was 0.25 g ml−1, and all other synthesis conditions were the same as for NiMoN@NiFeN.\nPreparation of IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts on Ni foam\nTo prepare the IrO2 electrode for comparison53, 40 mg of IrO2 and 60 μL of Nafion were dispersed in 540 μL of ethanol and 400 μL of DI water, and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min. The dispersion was then coated onto a Ni foam substrate, which was dried in air overnight. Pt/C electrodes were obtained by the same method.\nMaterials characterization\nThe morphology and nanostructure of the samples were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, LEO 1525) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2010F) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The phase composition of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (PANalytical X’pert PRO diffractometer with a Cu Ka radiation source) and XPS (PHI Quantera XPS) using a PHI Quantera SXM scanning X-ray microprobe.\nElectrochemical tests\nThe electrochemical performance was tested on an electrochemical station (Gamry, Reference 600). The two half reactions of OER and HER were each carried out at room temperature (~25 °C) in a standard three-electrode system with our prepared sample as the working electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode, and a standard Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode. Four different electrolytes, including 1 M KOH, 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, 1 M KOH + Seawater, and natural seawater, were used, and the pH was around 14 except for the natural seawater (pH~7.2). The electrode size is around 1 cm−2, and the effective parts in the electrolyte are 0.3 ~ 0.45 cm−2 for different samples. Both the anodes (NiMoN@NiFeN) and cathodes (NiMoN) were cycled ~100 times by CV until a stable polarization curve was developed prior to measuring each polarization curve. OER polarization curve measurements were performed by CV at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and stability tests were carried out under constant overpotentials. HER polarization curve measurements were performed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and stability tests were carried out under constant overpotentials. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at an overpotential of 270 mV from 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. For the two-electrode seawater electrolysis, the as-prepared NiMoN@NiFeN and NiMoN catalysts (after CV activation) were used as the anode and cathode, respectively. The polarization curves were measured in different electrolytes at different temperatures (25 and 60 °C), and stability tests were carried out under constant current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm−2 at room temperature.\nTurnover frequency (TOF) calculation\nThe TOF value is calculated from the Eq. (1)54,55:\n$${\\mathrm{TOF}} = \\frac{{j \\ast A \\ast {\\mathrm{\\eta }}}}{{4 \\ast F \\ast n}}$$\n (1) \nwhere j is the current density at a given overpotential, A is the surface area of the electrode, η is the OER Faradaic efficiency, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the total number of active sites on the electrode. To calculate TOF, the most significant challenge is to identify the number of active sites. Since the real active sites for the NiMoN@NiFeN catalyst are in situ formed NiFe oxide and NiFe oxy(hydroxide), we calculated the number of active sites by integrating the Ni redox peaks from the CV curve according to the following Eq. (2)55:\n$$n = \\frac{{Q \\ast N_A}}{{F \\ast R_{{\\mathrm{Ni}}/{\\mathrm{Fe}}}}}$$\n (2) \nwhere Q is the integration of Ni redox features from the CV curve (Supplementary Fig. 9d), NA is Avogadro’s constant, F is the Faraday constant, and RNi/Fe is the molar ratio of Ni/Fe, assuming that Ni2+/Ni3+ is a one-electron process. For the NiMoN@NiFeN catalyst at overpotential of 300 mV, j = 206 mA cm−2, and thus TOF was calculated to be 0.09 s−1 at overpotential of 300 mV.\nGas chromatography measurement\nOverall seawater splitting for gas chromatography (GC, GOW-MAC 350 TCD) tests were performed in a gas-tight electrochemical cell with 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl as the electrolyte at room temperature (25 °C). Chronopotentiometry was applied with a constant current density of 100 mA cm−2 to maintain oxygen and hydrogen generation. For each measurement over an interval of 10 min, 0.3 µL gas sample was carefully extracted from the sealed cell and injected into the GC instrument using a glass syringe (Hamilton Gastight 1002).\nOverall seawater splitting driven by a TE module\nWe purchased a commercial TE module from Amazon and used it as a power generator to drive our two-electrode electrolyzer according to our previous work12. During the test, the hot side of the TE module was covered by a large flat copper plate, which was in direct contact with a heater on top. The hot-side temperature was maintained relatively constant by tuning the DC power supply to the heater, while the cold-side temperature was controlled by placing it in direct contact with a cooling system, where the water inside was adjusted to remain at a constant temperature. Thus, the TE module generated a relatively stable open circuit voltage between the hot and cold sides. A nano-voltmeter and an ammeter were embedded into the circuit for real-time monitoring of the voltage and current, respectively, between the two electrodes of the water-splitting cell.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "NiMoO4 nanorods", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal method", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ni(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "0.04 M"}, "prc2": {"name": "(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O", "amount": "0.01 M"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "150 °C", "time": "6 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "NiMoN@NiFeN core-shell nanorods", "Syns_method": "thermal nitridation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "NiMoO4/Ni foam"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ni(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "0.1-0.75 g/mL"}, "prc3": {"name": "Fe(NO3)3·9H2O", "amount": "0.1-0.75 g/mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMF"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "nitridation", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "1 h", "gas": "NH3 and Ar"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "IrO2", "Syns_method": "coating", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "IrO2", "amount": "40 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "Nafion", "amount": "60 μL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "540 μL"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "400 μL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "coat"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "air overnight"}}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "Pt/C", "Syns_method": "coating", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Pt/C", "amount": "40 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "Nafion", "amount": "60 μL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "540 μL"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "400 μL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "coat"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "air overnight"}}}}}, "MAT5": {"name": "NiFeN nanoparticles", "Syns_method": "thermal nitridation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ni foam"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ni(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "0.25 g/mL"}, "prc3": {"name": "Fe(NO3)3·9H2O", "amount": "0.25 g/mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMF"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "nitridation", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "1 h", "gas": "NH3 and Ar"}}}}}}}

The foil was sliced into pieces of 10 mm × 15 mm× 0.89 mm. After mechanical polishing with sandpaper (400#, 1000#, 1500#, 2000#), the foil was ultrasonically rinsed in acetone, ethanol and distilled water for 5 min, respectively. Then the foil was put into a solution consisted of nitric acid, hydrogen fluoride and distilled water (4:1:5 in volume ratio) for 10 min. Eventually, the titanium foil was ultrasonically cleaned with distilled water for 10 min. Anodization was performed with 60 V applied potential for 30 min at room temperature controlled with a direct current power supply (IT6834, ITECH, China) in a glycol solution containing 0.5 wt% NH4F, 5 vol% H2O and 5 vol% methanol.

The foil was placed in a tube furnace to anneal at 450 ℃ for 3 h in air. 2.2 Preparation of RuO2-TiO2 NTAs and RuO2/IrO2-TiO2 NTAs Galvanostatic electrodeposition was controlled by a CHI660e potentiostat (CH Instruments). The solution consisted of 0.1 M KCl, 5 mM RuCl3 and 0.01 M hydrochloric acid. TiO2 NTAs served as the working electrode, with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt plate counter electrode (1.5 cm × 2.5 cm).

RuO2-TiO2 NTAs were prepared on the foil after annealing at 450 °C for 3 h in an air with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The procedure for preparing RuO2/IrO2-TiO2 NTAs is similar to that of RuO2-TiO2 NTAs.

As the modules became larger, the thermal time constant of the system significantly increased, i.e., heat transfer coefficient of module decreased and the furthest cells from the fans interchanged less heat to surrounding air. In addition, modular packaging improves the energy efficiency of the cooling system since it is more efficient to cool several small modules than cooling a larger one.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "LiCoO2", "application": "thermal management of lithium-ion battery modules", "props": {}}}}

Phase evolution in Ti-Si-C system is a complex phenomenon, and, present experimental conditions never yield a phase pure Ti3SiC2 MAX phase, rather results in varying volume fractions of Ti3SiC2-(Tix,Si1-x)C solid solution due to non-equilibrium processing conditions exerted by SPS processing which restricts coherent site specific diffusional jumps and promotes the formation of (Ti, Si)C solid-solution instead of well reported non-stoichiometric TiCx. 3Ti/SiC/C precursor was the best candidate for processing composite with highest yields of Ti3SiC2. Phase evolution is guided by the free energy of formation of different phases and chemical affinity amongst the constituent elements rather than the equilibrium phase diagram of the Ti-Si-C system. Presence of free carbon, low temperature liquid phase and slow heating rate are the key requirements for forming phase pure Ti3SiC2, where excess free carbon reduces the stability of Ti3SiC2 via decarburization.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "4 Experiment and discussion 4.1 Experimental processes To verify the ability of impedance model to simulate EIS and the adaptability of the model, we decided to measure EISs of three different types of LiBs and compare them with simulated EISs of impedance model. The experimental objects and process are described as follows. We used three types of LiBs as experimental objects and their specifications are listed in Table 1 . The experimental platform was built as Fig. 7 . The electrochemistry workstation was used to test the EIS of LiBs, the charge & discharge device was used for adjusting SOC of battery cells and the temperature chamber adjusted the environment temperature in the process of experiments. The detailed experimental process is shown as Fig. 8 . 4.2 Parameter identification No doubt the impedance model still has many parameters, even though it has been simplified in some extent. Before starting the parameter identification, we determined some parameters by direct measurement or consulting references at first. These parameters are shown in Table 2 . Apart from above parameters, we need to identify 14 parameters including electrolyte phase diffusion coefficient D e l e (m2/s), solid phase diffusion coefficient of negative electrode D s l d , n (m2/s), solid phase diffusion coefficient of positive electrode D s l d , p (m2/s), diffusion coefficient of compact SEI film D c S E I (m2/s), conductivity of compact SEI film σ c S E I (S/m), capacitance of compact SEI film C c S E I (F), double layer capacitance C D L (F), electrochemical reaction constant K (m2.5mol−0.5s−1), maximum solid phase lithium ion concentration of negative electrode c s l d , m a x n (mol/m−3), maximum solid phase lithium ion concentration of positive electrode c s l d , m a x p (mol/m−3), contact resistance R c t c (mΩ), contact capacitance C c t c (F), Ohmic resistance R O h m (mΩ), conductance of test wire L (H). These 14 parameters are identified using simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) based on measured EISs. SAA is a kind of global optimization algorithm, which is derived from the principle of solid annealing. The principle of solid annealing is described as: If a solid is heated to a high temperature and then let it slowly cool, the solid particles will become disordered and their internal energy will increase in heating stage, then they will become ordered in cooling stage and reach the equilibrium state at each cooling temperature, finally they will reach the ground state in normal temperature and their internal energy will reduce to minimum at the same time. Based on the annealing process, SAA set a high temperature as initial temperature and reduce the temperature in the whole parameter identification process. The objective function is regarded as internal energy of a solid and parameters at one temperature are regarded as the state of the solid. The whole process aims to reduce internal energy with the decrease of temperature until it becomes minimum. The random disturbance is exerted to parameters to simulate the disordered state of solid particles in the cooling process. To avoid the parameter identification process ends with a local optimal solution, Metropolis criterion described by Eq. (51) is introduced to judge acceptability of new solution. (51) P = { 1 , E t + 1 < E t exp ( E t − E t + 1 k T ) , E t + 1 ≥ E t where P is the probability to accept the new solution, E t and E t + 1 is the value of objective function at current step and next step, k is a parameter to control the acceptability, T is temperature. Eq. (51) means that the new solution is probably accepted, even through it larger than the last solution, which indicate that SAA can traverse many local optimal solutions and finally find out the global optimal solution. The detailed process of SAA is shown in Fig. 9 . SAA is a kind of method which sets initial ranges of model parameters and adjusts parameters to make the simulated results of model fit the measured results. Hence, multiple measured EIS results can be inputted into SAA and parameter sets for different measured results can be identified at the same time in EV application. Taking the online EIS measurement method based on active balancing circuit as an example, EIS data of balanced cells can be collected together and parameters of these cells can be identified together using the identification process as shown in Fig. 10 . In this way, lots of repeated identification process can be saved. The introduction of EIS data is to monitor changes of internal behaviors and diagnose faults in the battery degradation process. Considering that the degradation behaviors of batteries are not instantaneous, the identification process can be performed after several EIS data have been collected and doesn't have to be strictly real-time. 4.3 Model verification After the parameter identification, fitting EISs are obtained by simulating the impedance model with identified parameters with different SOC. Fitting EISs and measured EISs of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 under different SOC are compared, and the results are shown in Figs. 11 , 12 and 13 . To show the Nyquist plots under different SOC clearly, the Nyquist plots of different SOC are shift up one by one along the imaginary axis. As shown in Figs. 11, 12 and 13, the impedance model can fit EISs under different SOC well. The middle frequency region part of Nyquist plot, which has a trend of decreasing firstly and then increasing with the increase of SOC, is fitted accurately. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Relative Error (MRE) of the modulus of impedance between the impedance model and the measured data, as Eqs. (52) and (53), are used as the indexes for the evaluation the simulation accuracy of the impedance model. (52) M A E Z = | Z s i m , f 1 − Z m e a , f 1 | + | Z s i m , f 2 − Z m e a , f 2 | + … + | Z s i m , f n − Z m e a , f n | n (53) M R E Z = | Z s i m , f 1 − Z m e a , f 1 Z m e a , f 1 | + | Z s i m , f 2 − Z m e a , f 2 Z m e a , f 2 | + … + | Z s i m , f n − Z m e a , f n Z m e a , f n | n where Z m e a , f n is the modulus of impedance of the measured data at the frequency f n , Z s i m , f n is the modulus of impedances of the new model at the frequency f n . MARs and MREs between fitting data and measured data of three different types of LiBs under different SOC are listed as Table 3 and Table 4 , respectively. As shown in Table 3 and Table 4, the maximum MAE is only 1.46 mΩ. Regarding the MREs, the 3D TLM in Ref. [14] achieve the satisfactory accuracy with its MREs are below 1% and we think that our proposed impedance model also reaches the same level except from a slight increase of MREs at extremely low or high SOC. 4.4 Analysis of model parameters To analyze the influence of SOC on model parameters, 14 identified parameters in different SOC of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 are shown in Table 5 , Table 6 and Table 7 , respectively. The units of these parameters have been mentioned in Section 4.2. In these tables, we divide these parameters into three types: parameters unrelated to SOC, parameters weakly related to SOC and parameters highly related to SOC. Parameters unrelated to SOC include D e l e , c s l d , m a x n , c s l d , m a x p , R c t c , C c t c and L , parameters weakly related to SOC include D c S E I , C c S E I , σ c S E I and parameters highly related to SOC include D s l d , n , D s l d , p , C D L , K , R O h m . c s l d , m a x n and c s l d , m a x p are only related to the maximum capacity of batteries and their value should be fixed in different SOC without considering the degradation of batteries. Contact impedance is belong to electrical impedance rather than electrochemical impedance, so values of R c t c and C c t c are not influenced by the change of the lithium ion concentration and are consequently unrelated to SOC. The almost constant value of R c t c in different SOC is also observed in Ref. [7]. L is the inductance of the test wire, so its value is doubtlessly unrelated to SOC. Regarding D e l e , it is considered to change with the lithium ion concentration, while the lithium ion concentration in the bulk electrolyte does not vary with SOC. Hence, D e l e is set as parameter unrelated to SOC, which is the same as the way in Ref. [51]. In the parameter identification process, parameters unrelated to SOC can be set as constant values for all SOC. All parameters weakly related to SOC are used to describe SEI. These parameters are originally assumed as constant values for different SOC, because SEI impedance has no obvious changes with SOC as shown in Fig. 2(c). In the parameter identification process, we can get enough accurate fitting results of EIS in a specific SOC range (25%SOC to 95%SOC) but have to readjust these parameters in low SOC to get higher simulation accuracy. We can explain this phenomenon based on the formation of SEI. Authors in Ref. [29]. Found that SEI forms on the surface of negative electrode when the potential of negative electrode relative to Li/Li+is from 0.2 V to 1.0 V. When SOC is relatively high, this potential is less than 0.2 V. In this case, the formation of SEI does not take place. When SOC is close to 0, this potential is in the range of 0.2V∼1.0 V. In this case, the formation of SEI start to take place and the broken parts of SEI are restored, which hinders the lithium ion transport in SEI and causes the changes of D S E I , C c S E I and σ c S E I . The change of SEI impedance in the low SOC range can also be observed by the area of peak P3 in Fig. 2(c). Regarding parameters highly related to SOC, all three cells have similar trends. D s l d , n and D s l d , p show an obvious fluctuation, but do not show a regular trend with the change of SOC. Such trends can also be observed in Refs. [12,43]. C D L only shows a slight fluctuation except from the increase in low SOC, even though we regard it as parameter highly related to SOC. Ref. [12]also showed that C D L only has a slight change for different SOC. Hence, C D L could be regarded also as parameter weakly related to SOC and be fixed at specific SOC range in parameter identification process of EV application. K shows the most regular trend, which climbs up and then falls with increase of SOC. K reflects the resistance of the charge transfer process. The more K is, the less charge transfer resistance is. The trend of K is consistent with the relationship between the charge transfer resistance and SOC described in Ref. [24]. R O h m of Cell 1 and Cell 3 show a negative correlation with SOC, R O h m of Cell 2 also follows this correlation in low SOC, but keeps steady with increase of SOC. The decrease of R O h m with the increase of SOC is also observed in Ref. [43]. The trends of K and R O h m could be regarded as the common rules and the guidance to identify parameters in practical EV application.", "output": {}}

The Si NPs and lithium foil (China Energy Lithium Co., Ltd) with a mass ratio of 1:1.1 were placed in a stainless steel crucible and heated to 350 ℃ for alloying reaction for 3 h. After it dropped to room temperature, the resultant product was ground to obtain Li x Si NPs. 2.2 Synthesis of Al-treated LixSi NPs (A-LixSi) Aluminum isopropoxide powders (99.99%, Aladdin) were stirred and dissolved in cyclohexane ( ≥ 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) in the glove box to obtain aluminum isopropoxide solution with a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The ground Li x Si powder was added to the solution and stirred for 0.5 h. The precipitate was obtained by filtration, which was washed twice with cyclohexane. Finally, the obtained powder was heated to 130 ℃ in a stainless steel crucible for 2 h to obtain A-Li x Si. 2.3 Material characterizations The morphology of Li x Si and A-Li x Si were observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, HITACH SU8010) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, FEI TECNAI G2 F30).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI5000 Versa Probe II) was used to analyze the surface composition of A-Li x Si. 2.4 Preparation of electrodes The entire electrode preparation process was performed in an Ar-filled glove box. The active substance (Li x Si, A-Li x Si and graphite (99.95%, Macklin)), Super P (Canrd) and PVDF (Canrd) were added into the tetrahydrofuran solution (Sigma-Aldrich) according to a certain mass ratio, and stirred for 6 h to form a uniform slurry. Then the slurry was cast on a copper foil (Canrd) and the resulted composite foil was heated for 12 h on a heating table. Finally, the dried composite foil was cut into circular electrodes with a diameter of 12 mm. 2.5 Air stability test The air stability test was performed in a custom glove box filled with ambient air. A monitor was placed in the glove box to detect the changes in humidity and temperature. First, the glove box was evacuated to a vacuum state, and then a certain proportion of dry air and ambient air were introduced. By adjusting the ratio of the two gases, the box atmosphere of different humidity can be obtained. After the material has been placed in the glove box for a specified period of time, it can be transferred elsewhere for further experiments. 2.6 Electrochemical measurements The CR2032 coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box for further electrochemical measurement.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Synthesis of BMOFs Due to a series of advantages such as the synergy between different metals and characteristic metal open sites, people have made a lot of efforts in the synthesis of BMOFs [49,50]. In general, the methods of constructing BMOFs can be divided into two categories. The first type of synthesis of BMOFs is direct synthesis, such as hydrothermal/solvothermal method [51,52], nucleation kinetic control method [53,54] and microwave-assisted method [55–57], also known as one-pot synthesis. Another approach involves post-synthetic exchange [58–60], where a monometallic MOF is initially synthesized, followed by ion exchange or seed-induced doping to incorporate a second metal, thereby constructing a BMOF [61–64]. A critical challenge in all synthesis approaches is maintaining the structural stability of BMOFs to prevent degradation from solvent molecules through nucleophilic erosion [65,66]. The strength of metal binding forces significantly influences the structural integrity of BMOFs. The strength mainly relies on the oxidation state of the metal ion and the disparity in radius between the metal ion and other constituents [67,68]. The stronger these influencing factors are, the greater the ability of metal ions to attract electron clouds from other constituents [69,70]. Another major determinant of BMOFs performance is the quantity of open metal sites [71,72]. Efficient atom packing within the lattice reduces the quantity of available open metal sites, thereby crucially enhancing stability. Nevertheless, the existence of crystal defects is also pivotal for enabling applications such as catalysis and adsorption in BMOFs [73,74]. In addition, to crystallize BMOFs smoothly while maintaining their topology is the main challenge in the synthesis of BMOFs [75,76]. When the free energy of the liquid phase is greater than that of the solid phase, the BMOFs begin to form crystals spontaneously. In particular, the crystallization process represents a non-equilibrium phase transition that yields a thermodynamically stable phase. Of course, it is also essential to consider kinetic parameters such as driving forces, which contribute to a proper understanding of the growth mechanisms of BMOFs [77,78]. Moreover, the synthesis of BMOFs presents challenges that require careful attention, such as controlling the crystal periodicity during synthesis and preventing phase separation [79]. In general, it is very important to choose a suitable synthesis strategy when designing and synthesizing BMOFs. At present, the commonly used one-step method and post-synthesis exchange method have their own advantages and disadvantages. The one-step method usually involves the simultaneous introduction of two metal ions in a reaction process, which simplifies the experimental steps and may increase the yield [80–82]. However, this method may face challenges in controlling the proportion and distribution of metal ions. In contrast, the post-synthesis exchange method allows more precise regulation of the introduction and distribution of metal ions, and gradually synthesizes the target MOF through multiple stages, which can achieve better results in improving structural control and functionality [83–85]. In the following, we will introduce the specific application and applicable scenarios of these two methods in the synthesis of BMOFs. 2.1 Direct synthesis or one-pot synthesis The one-pot method is a common method for the synthesis of BMOFs. However, predicting the final topology of metal–organic frameworks through this method may be challenging due to the differing kinetic interactions between two metal ions and the ligands [85,86]. In order to construct a BMOF with ideal performance, precise control of the reaction conditions is essential [87,88]. For instance, factors such as the molar ratio of two metal sources, reaction time, solubility of metal ions, and pH of the reactant solution significantly influence the structure and morphology of resulting BMOFs [89–91]. The synthesis of BMOFs usually entails a reaction between a ligand and two metal ions that share similar electron configurations and charge densities [92,93]. After extensive exploration by many researchers, this method has been well established and a variety of BMOFs have been successfully synthesized. 2.1.1 Hydrothermal/solvothermal method Hydrothermal/solvothermal is a common method for the preparation of MOFs. The method is to dissolve organic ligands and metal complexes in water or other organic solvents, and then place the mixture at high temperature and high pressure [94]. Through the efforts of many scientific research groups, substantial advancements have been achieved in the synthesis of BMOFs [95,96]. In a simple synthesis using water as the solvent, many teams have provided ideas. For example, Chi and colleagues used a simple and controlled hydrothermal method to synthesize a Ni-Co organic framework at 150 °C [97]. The prepared samples can be directly used as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and displayed excellent electrochemical properties. Coincidentally, Tang’s group combined the advantages of zinc and cobalt into a single MOF crystal. And under their exploration, the composition of the two precursors can be adjusted to control the performance of the synthesized BMOF [98]. In fact, there are many explorations for the synthesis of BMOF by hydrothermal method. Hao and his colleagues synthesized the Ni/Mn BMOF, and used the sulfide (MWCNT)/Ni-Mn-S as the electrode material for the supercapacitor ( Fig. 3 a) [99]. At 1 A/g, Ni-Mn-S demonstrates a notable specific capacitance of 1041 mAh/g and maintains good cycle stability, retaining 83.3 % capacity after 10,000 cycles ( Fig. 3 b). Faced with the problem of short life cycle of LSB due to the “shuttle effect” generated by the cathode, Geng et al. disclosed the bimetallic Al/Cu-MOF based on Al-MOF as a sulfur host material ( Fig. 3 c) [100]. What's more, Rehman et al. used one-step hydrothermal synthesis to partially replace the Cu ions in Cu-MOF with Ni metal ions [101]. Subsequently, these BMOFs were added to the cellulose acetate matrix to prepare the mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) by solution casting technology ( Fig. 3 d). CO2 adsorption experiments were carried out at constant temperature and variable pressure. In addition, Guan et al. tried to grow bimetallic FeMn-MOF on nickel foam (NF) in one step [102]. The unique nanoflower-like structure of FeMn-MOF/NF makes it quite stable during the catalytic process. It can be directly used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and showed satisfactory catalytic activity and durability. Hydrothermal method is a simple and fast method for the synthesis of BMOFs, but it is often ineffective when it comes to water-sensitive compounds [103,104]. The solvothermal method is a synthesis method similar to the hydrothermal method, the only difference is that the reaction solvent is changed from simple water to organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide. Compared to single hydrothermal method, solvothermal method displays a wider range of application. However, different solvents will have a great impact on the morphology of the material. Hu et al. assembled Ni and Co metals on the MOF-74 structure by solvothermal method, and the obtained NiCo-MOF-74 showed good NO adsorption and separation performance [107]. Yang et al. proposed to use a porous three-dimensional(3D) carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) aerogel as a substrate for the growth of NiCo-MOF for the rapid and efficient removal of tetracycline hydrochloride ( Fig. 4 a) [108]. CMC aerogels feature a highly 3D porous structure that facilitates smooth passage of the solution, enhancing interaction between solution molecules and Ni/Co-MOF by extending contact time. Due to the above advantages, Ni/Co-MOF@CMC aerogel can quickly remove tetracycline hydrochloride within 5 min, with a removal rate of 80 % and an adsorption capacity of 624.87mg g−1. Of course, in addition to Ni and Co, there are other transition metals that are favored by scientists. For example, in 2022, Li et al. used Ti-Ln as the bimetal center and 4, 4′, 4′′, 4′′′- (pyrene-1, 3, 6, 8-tetrayl) tetra-benzoic acid (H4TBPy) as the photosensitizer ligand, and constructed a novel BMOF in one step by solvothermal method to improve the photocatalytic activity of bisphenol a (BPA) ( Fig. 4 b) [109]. The results show that compared with a single Ln/Ti-MOF, the 1:1 ratio of Ti-Ln-MOF has a significant improvement in the adsorption performance of BPA. Significantly, this is the first bimetallic Ti-Ln-MOF that can effectively photocatalytically degrade BPA, introducing a novel construction approach for enhancing the catalytic efficiency of MOFs in addressing environmental pollutants. In the same year, Han et al. prepared a La-Zr BMOF sorbent with La and Zr salt precursors and 2-aminoterephthalic acid ligands ( Fig. 4 c) [110]. The La-Zr/MOF prepared by solvothermal preparation can effectively adsorb Cr (VI) or As (V) in strongly acidic solution, and its adsorption performance is positively correlated with the crystallinity of La-Zr/MOF. In addition, Khosravi et al. had the idea of synthesizing Fe-Cu MOFs by a one-pot solvothermal method, as catalysts for the reduction of nitro compounds and organic fuels at room temperature [111]. The schematic diagram of NH2-BDC-Fe Cu MOF synthesis is shown in Fig. 4 d. Due to the synergy between Fe and Cu metals, Fe-Cu MOFs exhibit better catalytic performance than monometal MOF. More importantly, there was no change in the activity of the Fe-Cu MOF catalyst after the reduction of nitrobenzene after seven consecutive cycles. In addition, Wang et al. synthesized FeNi-MOFs by solvothermal method, and used them for persulfuric acid activation [112]. Fortunately, FeNi-MOFs have performed well in persulfuric acid activation, with higher specific activity than the most advanced catalysts reported to date. Similarly, Wang et al. have done a lot of work on BMOFs as electrocatalysts for OER, and they synthesized a series of MOFs by combining Fe with Ni, Co, and Zn [113]. Among these, NNU-23 exhibited superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 365 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH, surpassing the majority of previously reported MOF-based OER electrocatalysts. Of course, in addition to simple BMOFs, we also see more innovative bimetal hybrid ligand MOFs. For example, Shan and colleagues used a simple solvothermal method to select two ligands, trimellitic acid and terephthalic acid, and reacted with nickel and cobalt metal salts to synthesize a series of MOFs to photodegrade methylene blue under xenon light sources ( Fig. 4 e) [114]. The photocatalytic efficiency of metal–organic framework compounds is significantly enhanced by the synergistic effect of nickel–cobalt bimetallic ions and the incorporation of dual ligands. 2.1.2 Microwave method Among the various strategies for the synthesis of BMOFs, the aqueous/solvothermal method is the most common and the most used method. However, the water/solvothermal method has a lot of disadvantages such as high equipment requirements, long reaction time, and high energy consumption [115–117]. Microwaves are electromagnetic waves that fall between infrared radiation and radio waves with frequencies of 300 MHz – 300 GHz and wavelengths ranging from 1 m –1 mm. Under the action of electromagnetic fields, the particles of the material can produce polarizations such as electronic polarization, atomic polarization, orientation polarization, and space charge polarization [118,119]. Microwave heating, unlike traditional external heating methods, provides rapid volumetric heating without the need for heat conduction, ensuring uniform heating in a short time [31]. To be precise, microwave methods leverage the strengths of both microwave and water/solvothermal techniques, enabling rapid attainment of high temperatures and pressures. This approach markedly decreases preparation times within enclosed reaction systems [120–122]. Undoubtedly, microwave methods have received increasing attention and are recognized as a promising green method for the synthesis of BMOFs. In 2018, Vera V et al. used microwave method to prepare bimetallic Zn/Co-ZIF with different Zn:Co ratios [123]. After a careful study of the morphology, structure and electronic properties of the obtained materials, it was found that with the increase of Co content, the amount of solvent and iodine adsorbed on the crystal surface decreased, while the amount of iodine adsorbed in the pores remained basically unchanged. Li et al. reported mesoporous ternary Co-Ni-O nanorods by microwave method based on Co/Ni-MOF-74 nanorods and used in lithium storage [124]. Fig. 5 a illustrates the synthesis process of the Co-Ni-O nanorods. Due to the mesoporous structure of the nanorods and the synergistic effect of the two active metal oxides, the mesoporous Co-Ni-O nanorods provide a reversible capacity greater than the theoretical 1410 mAh/g after 200 cycles repeated at 100 mA/g (Fig. 5 b). Some researchers show a strong interest in metal tin. Mao et al. combined Sn with Cr to explore the effect of acid regulators on microwave synthesis of MOFs [125]. Bimetallic MIL-101 (Cr, Sn) was prepared by microwave method using six acids (acetic acid, nitric acid, formic acid, hydrochloric acid, succinic acid and citric acid). By studying the changes in volume, structure, stability, catalytic performance, size and shape of MIL-101 (Cr, Sn), it was concluded that all modulated formulations changed the properties of MOFs. Using acetic acid as a modulator, the morphology of the MOF was subtly altered, reducing particle size distribution and enhancing specific surface area compared to other samples. This modification notably improved the MOF’s water and thermal stability. Another thought of using metal Sn was Nguyen, and in order to solve the problem of the lack of stability of MIL-888, they tried to replace Fe3+ ions with Sn ions in different proportions [126]. Of course, in addition to Sn, they also used Ni2+ and Mg2+ to replace Fe3+, and these BMOFs synthesized by microwave method show significantly different photocatalytic properties. The results showed that the rhodamine B removal rate of the 10 % Ni/Fe-MOF sample reached more than 96 % after irradiation for 120 min. In addition, there is also a role in the synthesis of BMOF by microwave method in the Fenton-like reaction. For example, in 2018, Wang and his colleagues attempted to prepare FeCu BMOFs to promote Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling ( Fig. 5 c) [127]. When the microwave reaction temperature is 100 °C, the reaction time is only 1.5 h. BUC-96 showed superior decontamination performance via H2O2 activation without additional energy input, surpassing other monometallic or bimetallic catalysts. In addition, Katugampalage et al. synthesized FeCo MIL-88 nanorods rich in unsaturated metal centers using a microwave-assisted solvothermal method. These nanorods were employed as Fenton-like catalysts for oxytetracycline degradation [128]. The microwave synthesis platform can be synthesized at 140 °C in only 20 min, and it was found that BMOFs had higher acidic and catalytic activity, which were much higher than monometallic MOFs. 2.1.3 Kinetic control method From the above, we know that the microwave method is favored for its fast and efficient heating and good product uniformity, and is suitable for applications that require a short time to complete the synthesis. However, for some special core–shell MOFs with two different metals, the performance is unsatisfying. To date, the synthesis of core–shell MOFs has mostly adopted a step-by-step strategy, that is, the nucleus is synthesized first and then used as a seed for the growth of shell crystals [129,130]. Because of the metal secondary structural units (SBUs) of the core are consistent with the SBUs of the shell, the growth of core–shell MOFs often requires lattice matching [131,132]. Nevertheless, the cumbersome step-by-step synthesis and stringent lattice matching constraints impede the advancement of core–shell MOFs. A simple and convenient synthesis strategy needs to be explored. Currently, the prevailing technology involves constructing a core–shell structure by simultaneously controlling the nucleation and growth rates of two distinct MOFs in a single step [133–135]. Success hinges on the ability to utilize identical reaction conditions where seeds with rapid nucleation rates grow as guest MOFs, encapsulated by host MOFs with slower nucleation rates, thereby forming core–shell BMOFs [136,137]. However, creating core–shell structures using a one-step synthesis is challenging and requires precise control. Although the synthesis is difficult, there are breakthroughs in this area. For example, Yang’s group used a one-pot synthesis to successfully synthesize a lattice-mismatched hybrid core–shell MOF (PCN-222@Zr-BPDC) under kinetic control [138]. The synthesis method is shown in Fig. 6 a. Due to the strong binding of the highly connected ligand H4TCPP (tetrakis 4-carboxyphenyl porphyrin) to metal cations, it can be nucleated quickly and uniformly. In contrast, ligands coordinate with low connectivity BPDC (biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) usually takes longer under the same conditions. This indicates the potential to expand the one-pot nucleation kinetic control strategy to synthesize hybrid core–shell MOFs incorporating diverse types of metals. Guo et al. employed in-situ optical techniques to investigate the reaction kinetics of various metal ions in ZIF-8/ZIF-67, a representative BMOF system [139]. When Co and Zn ions are simultaneously present in the initial solution, uniform distribution of the two metals occurs only at high Co/Zn ratios. Conversely, at low Co/Zn ratios, distinct concentration gradients of the two metals are observable, extending from Co-rich nuclei to Zn-rich shells ( Fig. 6 b). Furthermore, by sequentially adding the two metals, a more intricate structure can be attained. Among these approaches, ZIF-67@ZIF-8 core–shell nanocrystals can be synthesized by initially adding Co2+. The thickness ratio of the core–shell structure can be adjusted by varying the time intervals during synthesis. However, when Zn2+ was added first, irregularly shaped aggregates were formed due to the weaker nucleation ability of Zn2+. This finding offers valuable insights for synthesizing novel hybrid MOF nanostructures. Wang et al. revealed two kinetic factors for the construction of core–shell MOF, namely nuclear kinetic factor and dissolution kinetic factor, by controlling the uniform and continuous growth of four types of Zr/Hf-MOF shells on seven different core MOFs [140]. The kinetics of nucleation governs the size of the shell MOF nucleus, impacting both the surface coverage of the shell MOF and the uniformity of the core MOF. The dissolution kinetics plays a crucial role in determining the rate at which the core MOF dissolves during growth, particularly significant for acid-labile core MOFs like ZIF-8. The different morphologies produced by the control of dissolution kinetics and nucleation kinetics are shown in the Fig. 6 c. This provided guidance for the construction of more complex layered MOF composites. In terms of MOF-on-MOF heterostructure, nucleation dynamics also has its own room for development. For example, Wang et al. introduced a polyvinylpyrrolidone −assisted kinetic control strategy to realize the “anti-epitaxial growth” mode of exogenous MOF nuclei on the UiO-66-NH2 octahedral seed (111) surface, and constructed a variety of two-dimensional (2D) on 3D MOF heterostructures [141]. Fig. 6 d provides a detailed depiction of the deposition and growth mechanism leading to the formation of a 2D-on-3D structure. Above all, we reviewed the progress of one-pot synthesis in BMOFs, both advantages and disadvantages of one-pot synthesis method are revealed. First of all, this kind of method is simple to operate, which integrates multiple reaction steps into a reaction container, thus simplifying the synthesis process, but this simple operation method also needs to strictly control the reaction conditions to achieve [142,143]. Secondly, the one-pot synthesis method can easily control the concentration ratio of the two metal ions, but the periodicity of the heterometallic arrangement cannot be determined, and it is easy to cause crystal defects [144]. Based on this, more methods need to be explored to achieve BMOFs. 2.2 Post-synthetic exchange The post-synthesis exchange (PSE) is an effective way to synthesize BMOFs, as it can help synthesize unconventional BMOFs that are difficult or impossible to obtain by direct synthesis methods [145,146]. In contrast to the one-pot synthesis method, it allows for subsequent metal ion substitution on monometal MOFs that have already been synthesized [147,148]. In this method, new metal ions can be selectively replaced or added to maintain the framework of the monometal MOF while adjusting the chemical and physical properties, such as pore size, surface chemistry, and electron transport capacity [149–151]. In addition, by precisely controlling reaction conditions and selecting the right combination of metals, researchers can modulate the chemical activity, electron transport properties, and catalytic activity of MOFs to meet the demand for high-performance functional materials in different fields [152–154]. This is in line with the requirements of researchers to design and synthesize BMOF according to specific application requirements [155,156]. Therefore, more and more people have begun to explore the synthesis of BMOFs using the post-synthetic exchange method. Cohen’s group was the first to demonstrate that MIL-53 for different metal elements can be obtained by metal ion PSE ( Fig. 7 a) [157]. PXRD confirmed that the crystallinity of the MOF did not change while particles contained both Fe and Al ions. What's more, the authors also got the same results with lanthanides. Similarly, they confirmed that ligand exchange can also occur between solid samples. Based on the above, it was determined that ligands and metal ion PSEs can be present in a variety of chemically robust MOFs. In addition, the same group also conducted an in-depth study on the process of metal ion PSE in ZIFs [158]. They explored in two different ways: (a) first exchanging organic linkers and then metal cations; (b) the reverse process, where the exchange of organic ligands is followed by the exchange of metal ions ( Fig. 7 b). Dinca et al. have done a great deal of work on the PSE process to synthesize materials that are not available in a one-pot process [159]. By incorporating the first row of bivalent and trivalent transition metals into MOF-5 SBUs, they obtained BMOFs especially the first batch of MOFs containing Ti3+ and V2+, as well as five other previously unknown MOF-5 analogues. Kim et al. demonstrated the complete reversible exchange of metal ions in the MOF [160]. A new Cd-MOF was soaked in Pb (NO3)2 aqueous solution for one week, it was observed that Cd (II) ions in the framework were completely exchanged by Pb (II) ions without losing structural integrity ( Fig. 7 c). Interestingly, the rapid exchange of Pb (II) to Cd (II) is almost 98 % within 2 h ( Fig. 7 d), while the reverse exchange process takes longer. In one day, Cd (II) exchanged about 50 % of Pb (II), and it took nearly 3 weeks to complete the exchange ( Fig. 7 e). Zhou et al. successfully introduced Ti (IV) into the SBUs of UiO-66 by microwave-assisted reaction [161]. It was found that the exchange rate exceeded 50 % after only 4 h, which is a very fast reaction process compared to the more than 10 h of one-pot synthesis ( Fig. 7 f). As revealed above, the synthesis of BMOFs by PSE is a rapid process, but the reaction kinetics is somehow misty. Song et al. investigated the kinetics by two zinc-based 3D MOFs with the same SBUs but interconnected by different organic ligands [162], Zn-HKUST-1 with a small and rigid ligand ( Fig. 8 a), and Zn-PMOF-2 with a larger and flexible ligand ( Fig. 8 b). As a result, full metallization can be achieved in the flexible Zn-PMOF-2 frame ( Fig. 8 d), while only partial metallization can be observed in the rigid Zn-HKUST-1 frame ( Fig. 8 c). In addition, Dinca et al. revealed the factors that enable cation exchange on certain SBUs [163]. They observed that exchangeable metal ions are partially solvated when immersed in solution. Although not all structures can be dissolved, many metal sites in other SBUs usually have the characteristics of binding solvent molecules. The prevalence of partially solvated SBUs and the coordination changes experienced during the solvation process make people question whether the metal sites are indeed unsaturated when surrounded by solvents. On this basis, the cation exchange mechanism is established, which is helpful to understand this process ( Fig. 8 e). At the same time, some recent work on the synthesis of BMOFs by PSE strategy deserves attention. For example, Zhao et al. synthesized a Zn/Ni Bi-MOF, which cannot be achieved by the direct synthesis method, and transformed Zn/Ni Bi-MOF into a unique ZnO/NiO heterostructure by calcination. The sensor based on this heterostructure has an ultrahigh response of 280.2 to 500 ppm n-propanol at 275 ℃, which is 17.2 times higher than that of ZnO. In addition, Ma et al. synthesized CdCu BMOF through PSE and applied it to the electrocatalytic oxidation of uric acid. Similarly, Yu et al. successfully synthesized ZnCu-MOF and ZnCd-MOF by using Zn-MOF as precursor and introducing Cu and Cd ions through PSE. Compared with Zn-MOF, both ZnCu-MOF and ZnCd-MOF exhibit significantly enhanced third-order nonlinear optical absorption properties (NLO), which provides more possibilities for further adjusting NLO properties. In summary, PSE is another method used to synthesize BMOFs, which allows BMOFs to obtain a single-crystal to single-crystal transition. However, it also has some problems, such as slow exchange process and uncontrollable exchange rate, so in specific applications, it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons according to the actual situation and choose the appropriate synthesis method.", "output": {}}

Figure 1 shows the synthetic route of silicon-carbon composites and the corresponding photos during the preparation of materials. First, litchi shells are crushed with a wall breaker. The crushed particles are washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove impurities from the surface of litchi shells and dried overnight at 120°C. Subsequently, 3 g litchi shell particles are dispersed in 100 mL 1 M ZnCl2 solution by ultrasonic treatment (KQ-100DE), and the uniform suspension is obtained after magnetic stirring for 24 h. In order to maintain the integrity of the litchi shell structure and prevent the collapse of the internal structure, the litchi shell suspension soaked in ZnCl2 is transferred to a freeze-dryer (LGJ-10E). It was pre-frozen at −70°C for 12 h and then lyophilized until the material was completely dried. After freeze-drying, litchi shells were placed in a tubular furnace and heated from room temperature to 600°C in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5°C min−1. After annealing at 600°C for 2 h, the litchi shell was naturally cooled to room temperature. Litchi shell-derived activated carbon (LAC) was prepared by washing the sample with 1 M HCl solution and then using deionized water to wash the sample to neutral. In addition, litchi shell-derived no-activated carbon (LNC) was prepared by using the same method to prepare the litchi shell without the use of ZnCl2 solution. Subsequently, commercial nano-silicon particles and LAC were evenly mixed using a ball mill (JX-2019-3*2ML) with a mass ratio of 1:1. The evenly mixed materials were dispersing in absolute ethanol (99.9%) with the 20:1 of mass ratio of ball to material and running the high-energy ball milling at 800 rpm for 5 h. The mixture after high-energy ball milling was washed with anhydrous ethanol and filtered through a 500-mesh sieve to obtain silicon-carbon composite 3D LAC@Si. Similarly, the comparative sample LNC@Si was also prepared in the same way.\nFig. 1\nSynthesis of silicon-carbon composite from litchi shell\nFull size image\nMaterial characterization\nNitrogen desorption experiments were carried out on the samples by a specific surface and aperture analyzer (JWGB SCI. & TECH. JW-BK222). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET, Autosorb IQ, Quantachrome, America) was used to calculate specific surface area and analyze pore size distribution at 77 K. The morphology and microstructure of silicon-carbon composites were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU8010) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOLJEM2100F). The phase composition and structure characteristics of the samples were analyzed with X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, D8 ADVANCE A25, using a Cu-Ka radiation source). XRD pattern data have an angular range of 10-90° and a step length of 0.02°. The graphitization degree of the material was characterized by Raman spectroscopy.\nThe silicon-carbon composites were tested with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on Thermo Fisher Escalab 250XI. Mono Al Ka (monochromatic X-ray source) was used to analyze the elemental composition and atomic hybridization types of the prepared materials.\nElectrochemical measurements\nIn order to study the electrochemical properties of composite materials, semi-batteries were assembled for testing. CR2025 coin semi-battery was assembled with lithium foil as electrodes in a glove box filled with high purity argon (water < 0.1 ppm, oxygen < 0.1 ppm). The active material 3D LAC@Si (80%), acetylene black (10%), and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose CMC (10%) were placed in a mortar and ground evenly. An appropriate amount of deionized water was added drop by drop to make each material disperse evenly to avoid agglomeration. The obtained slurry was evenly coated on the copper foil using a coater (Automatic Film Applicator BEVS18811/2); then, the copper foil was dried for 8 h in a 120°C vacuum dryer, and the sheets were pressed into 14 mm electrodes. The electrode plate load was 1.5-1.6 mg cm−2 (Si content is 50%). Lithium metal sheet was used as the reference anode, nickel foam was used as the support material, and high porosity polypropylene (Celgard 2500) membrane was used as the diaphragm. The mixture of 1 M LiPF6/vinyl carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (V:V = 1:1) was used as an electrolyte, and 10% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) with extra volume was added as an electrolyte additive.\nThe constant current charge and discharge experiment was performed at a constant temperature of 25°C and a voltage range of 0.02-1 V. The CT2100A LAND battery test system was used for testing. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed using an electrochemical workstation (Princeton 4000A, America) with a scanning range of 0.02-1 V and a scanning speed of 0.1 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured using an electrochemical workstation at frequencies ranging from 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz. In addition, the same method was used to prepare a half-cell with LNC@Si as a negative electrode for electrochemical testing as a comparative sample.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "3D LAC@Si", "Syns_method": "freeze-drying and high-energy ball milling", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "LAC", "amount": "50%"}, "prc2": {"name": "nano-silicon", "amount": "50%"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "dispersed in ethanol (ball to material ratio 20:1)"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "high-energy ball milling", "parameters": {"time": "5 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "LNC@Si", "Syns_method": "freeze-drying and high-energy ball milling", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "LNC", "amount": "50%"}, "prc2": {"name": "nano-silicon", "amount": "50%"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "dispersed in ethanol (ball to material ratio 20:1)"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "high-energy ball milling", "parameters": {"time": "5 h"}}}}}}}

With the CSCS method, the phase transformation of TiO2 from anatase (a-TiO2) to amorphous (am-TiO2) was observed as a result of the combustion process.

The calculated average size (D) of o-YFeO3 crystals was in the range of about 35–56 nm; the largest D belonged to the case of pure YFeO3. All of the samples were shown to be mesopore adsorbents with pore widths of 40–50 nm. A synergistic effect between TiO2-added and YFeO3-based components was discovered. In comparison to pure YFeO3, TiO2/YFeO3 composites were developed for methyl violet photodegradation.

Despite the great efforts made to pursue high-accuracy modeling of the heat generation and transfer processes inside lithium-ion batteries for control purposes, little work has shed light on the error sources in such electrothermal modeling for obtaining an optimal model. In this article, we propose a practical and general framework for investigating the potential error sources in computationally efficient electrothermal modeling of large-format lithium-ion batteries. The results demonstrate that the high-accuracy modeling of the thermal interplay between two tabs and the cell body and the optimization of the temperature sensor placements should be given high priority. Further, the overpotential-based method is preferred to calculate the local generation rates of the battery body for accuracy and generalizability. This study provides important insights into accurate and computationally efficient electrothermal modeling for large-format energy storage batteries.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "large-format lithium-ion batteries", "application": "electrothermal modeling for large-format energy storage batteries", "props": {}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "All reagents were analytical-grade reagents and were used without further purification. In a typical synthesis method, 4 mmol of stannic chloride (SnCl4·5H2O, 99%, Fisher Scientific) was dissolved 20 mL of distilled water, and 28 mmol of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99% S.D. Fine) dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water was added, and the mixture was stirred for 20 min. The resulting white solution was then transferred to an 80 mL-capacity Teflon autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 12 h. This pristine SnO2 sample is named SnO. For the SnO2/Ni nanocomposite, the addition of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)3) is carried out. 4 wt% Ni was obtained via dissolving a suitable amount of nickel nitrate in a minimum amount of distilled water, and addition was done in situ to the SnO reaction solution. This sample is named SnNi. For SnO2/CNT, the addition of 1 wt% commercial CNTs (the activation of the CNTs was carried out before use) was done in situ to the SnO reaction solution. This sample is named SnCn. For the preparation of SnO2/Ni/CNT, 4 wt% Ni and 1 wt% activated CNTs were added in situ to the SnO reaction solution. This sample is named SnNiCn. Also, for comparison, we synthesized and analyzed samples of SnNi, SnCn, and SnNiCn with different wt% levels in their compositions, which are named SnNi-2% (2 wt% Ni), SnNi-6% (6 wt% Ni), SnCn-0.5% (0.5 wt% CNTs), SnCn-1% (1 wt% CNTs), SnNiCn-2% (2 wt% Ni and 1 wt% CNTs), and SnNiCn-6% (6 wt% Ni and 1 wt% CNTs). The as-prepared precipitate was separated via centrifugation, washed with distilled water several times, and finally washed with ethanol. The product was dried at 80 °C overnight. The dried products of SnNi, SnCn, and SnNiCn were annealed at 550 °C for 3 h under a nitrogen atmosphere at a rate of 5 °C min−1. Due to annealing, the Ni oxides get reduced to Ni, which is formed during hydrothermal treatment, and the carbonization of the CNTs occurs.8 These SnO, SnNi, SnCn, and SnNiCn samples are used for further analysis and comparisons hereafter.\nThe crystal structures of all the synthesized anode nanostructures were examined via powder X-ray diffraction techniques (XRD, Bruker Advanced D8) using a Cu Kα radiation source. Morphological and micro-structural analysis of all as-synthesized nanostructures was carried out via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi, S-4800) and field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM, JEOL JEM-2200FS). The surface chemical compositions were studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Theta Probe). Room-temperature micro-Raman scattering analysis was performed using a HR 800-Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon), with excitation at 532 nm. Particle sizes were calculated using Particle Sizing Systems apparatus (Santa Barbara, Calif., USA).\nTo perform electrochemical measurements, 2032-type coin cells were used. The active material, conducting carbon, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder were mixed at a weight ratio of 80 : 10 : 10 with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent. The prepared slurry was cast onto a copper current collector with the help of a doctor blade and was dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h at 120 °C before being used as a working electrode. After drying under ambient conditions, round discs 16 mm in diameter were punched out and further dried under vacuum at 120 °C. The 2032-type coin half-cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, using metallic lithium foil (75 μm in thickness) as the counter and reference electrode, quartz filter paper as the separator, 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) : dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1 : 1 in volume) (BASF) as the electrolyte, and the round discs as the working electrodes. Electrochemical measurements (galvanostatic charge–discharge tests) were carried out using a battery analyzer (MTI) (vs. Li/Li+) at room temperature. The cyclic voltammetry behaviour of the half cells was tested using a potentiostat/galvanostatic instrument (Metrohm Autolab) between 0.005 V and 3 V with a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed at an amplitude of 5 mV with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz.\n", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "SnO", "Syns_method":

And then, the mixture was continually stirred at 35 °C for 24 h. After that, the acidic suspension was washed with deionized water for several times and centrifuged until the pH > 6. Finally, the Ti3C2Tx MXene was obtained by lyophilization process. Synthesis of a-V 2 O 5 @Ti 3 C 2 T x heterostructure: Firstly, 1.18 g V2O5 powder and 1.06 g H2C2O4 were added into 12 ml deionized water. After that, the mixture was kept at 75 °C for 2 h. And then, the dark blue VOC2O4 solution was obtained. Subsequently, 150 mg Ti3C2Tx MXene was added into the above VOC2O4 solution with stirring for 1 h. Whereafter, the as-prepared solution was dried by vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 24 h. Finally, the dried powder was annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at 300 °C for 2 h to obtain the a-V2O5@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure. The practical weight ratio of Ti3C2Tx in the a-V2O5@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure is about 25.7%. For comparison, the different amount Ti3C2Tx MXene (75 mg and 300 mg) were used to prepare other contrast samples, which were named a-V2O5@Ti3C2Tx-75 and a-V2O5@Ti3C2Tx-300 heterostructure, respectively. The practical weight ratio of Ti3C2Tx in the a-V2O5@Ti3C2Tx-75 and a-V2O5@Ti3C2Tx-300 heterostructure are around 14.8% and 40.9%, respectively. In addition, the synthesis process of a-V2O5 was analogous to that of a-V2O5@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure without adding Ti3C2Tx MXene. 2.2 Characterization The crystal structure, valence state and composition information of as-prepared materials were examined with X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Discover, Bruker Axs) and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo).

Firstly, the as-synthesized products, black carbon and polyvinylidene fluoride with a mass ratio of 7:2:1 were mixed in a certain amount of N-methylpyrrolidone solvent. Whereafter, the as-prepared slurry was coated on titanium foil and dried in vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. After that, the titanium foil was cut into Φ12 mm cathode. The mass loading of the active material was 0.9–1.2 mg cm−2. Subsequently, the coin-type cells were assembled in air with Zn foil as the anode, 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 (98%, Aladdin Co.

Then, 4 mL of 30 % hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was slowly added. After reacting at 40℃ for 30 min, 0.4 g of sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3, Jiangsu Qiangsheng Functional Chemical Co., Ltd.) was added stirred. After stirring for 10 min, adjusted PH value of the solution to 5.5–6.0 by added a certain amount of dilute hydrochloric acid. Finally, the obtained solution was filtered and dehydrated, washed clean, and dried in the oven at 40−50℃ for 6 h and got finished products. 2.2 Preparation of OS-PAA 0.135 g of the oxidized starch produced in the previous process and 0.135 g of PAA ((C3H4O2)N, MV ∼450000, Aladdin) available on the market were added to 8 g deionized water.

Here, two rare-earth metal based MOFs microcrystals with regular octahedral morphology (size about 15–20 µm), namely MOF 1 and MOF 2 were successfully fabricated. The derived carbon materials, which remained stable octahedral morphology were obtained by carbonization of as-synthetized MOFs at 450 °C under the N2 atmosphere, named complex 1 and complex 2. Further investigation manifested that carbonization could effectively enhance the EMWA performance of these MOFs. Complex 1 attained the minimum RL value of − 23.22 dB and a broad effective adsorption bands(EAB) of 5.76 GHz. Similarly, the minimum RL value for complex 2 attained − 22.31 dB under the thickness of 2.5 mm with the broad EAB of 4.16 GHz.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "complex 1", "application": "electromagnetic wave absorption materials", "props": {"reflection_loss": "-23.22 dB @ 2.5 mm", "effective_absorption_bandwidth": "5.76 GHz @ 2.5 mm"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "complex 2", "application": "electromagnetic wave absorption materials", "props": {"reflection_loss": "-22.31 dB @ 2.5 mm", "effective_absorption_bandwidth": "4.16 GHz @ 2.5 mm"}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Synthesis strategies for the preparation of electrode materials for PIBs Before delving into ZIF-based PIB electrodes, it's essential to grasp the basic structure of ZIFs. ZIFs are extended three-dimensional structured crystals consisting of tetrahedral metal ions (e.g., Zn2+ and Co2+) attached to imidazolates (Im). The structural unit of MN4 formed by ZIFs through the attachment of metal ions M (Zn2+ or Co2+) to four N atoms is very similar to that of SiO4 and AlO4 in conventional zeolites, forming an M–Im–M bonding angle of 145°, which is very close to that of Si–O–Si in zeolites [60]. The energy storage properties of ZIFs are intricately tied to their structural and chemical composition. A wide range of ZIFs can be synthesized by varying the metal ion species and imidazolate diversity. A brief overview of ZIF synthesis is necessary to determine an appropriate method for preparing ZIF-based PIB electrodes [61]. Several factors affect the final structure of ZIFs during the preparation process, with the type of solvent and imidazolate ligand used being particularly crucial. For example, ZIF-67 synthesized under room-temperature conditions using deionized water as the solvent exhibited a nanocubic structure [62], while one prepared in methanol was dodecahedral [63]. The methods and parameters utilized in synthesizing ZIFs, such as reaction temperature, time, reactant concentration, ratio, pressure, and pH, significantly impact the structure, properties, and applications of ZIFs. Existing literature has detailed various synthesis methods for ZIFs, encompassing aqueous/solvent thermal, sonochemical, microwave, and electrostatic spinning techniques. In recent years, researchers have devised numerous synthetic routes to produce ZIFs with diverse sizes, morphologies, and compositions. These approaches contribute to the complexity of ZIF crystals, facilitating the fabrication of architectures spanning from one-dimensional (1D) to three-dimensional (3D) using assisted methodologies [50]. Traditionally, aqueous/solvent thermal and self-assembly methods have been the main synthetic routes for ZIFs. Research has shown that pristine ZIFs are not suitable as electrodes for LIBs due to issues like insufficient electrical conductivity and structural instability [64]. Given their lack of adaptability to PIB systems with larger ionic radii, ZIFs are therefore not suitable for direct use as PIB electrodes. However, ZIFs possess a regular pore structure that can act as precursors and sacrificial templates for the preparation of ZIF-derived nanomaterials via pyrolysis. Various ZIF-derived materials with excellent physicochemical properties have been synthesized through solid-state transformation of ZIFs as precursors or templates at elevated temperatures or solution-based reactions involving specific chemical components. These materials encompass carbon materials, alloying materials, metal selenides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, and metal tellurides, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . Due to their abundant carbon organics and well-defined pore structures, ZIFs can be pyrolyzed in an inert or reducing atmosphere to produce a stable carbon framework, serving as crucial precursors/templates for porous carbon material fabrication. To create porous carbon materials with ample voids, it is feasible to eliminate the metal component in ZIFs, achieved through H2SO4 etching [65] or high-temperature volatilization of Zn [66]. The versatility of organic ligands enables the attainment of remarkable properties, including heteroatom (e.g., N, S) doping. Li et al. mixed 2-methylimidazole and thiourea in a methanol solution, reacted it with a Co source, and synthesized S-ZIF-67 [67]. Subsequently, the resulting material underwent carbonization and etching to enlarge the interlayer spacing with S and enhance electrical conductivity with N for co-doped characteristics. Employing the ZIF templating strategy preserves the underlying carbon framework, facilitating the fabrication of heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials with high specific surface areas. Similar to MOFs, ZIF-derived PIB electrodes provide the advantage of incorporating heteroatoms such as Se, S, and P. These heteroatoms may synergistically interact with the abundant N in ZIFs, potentially yielding unforeseen results. Researchers have documented various methods for synthesizing ZIF-derived metal selenides, including direct carbonization selenidation [68,69], solvothermal/hydrothermal selenidation [70], ion-exchange selenidation [71]. Similar preparations of ZIF-derived metal sulfides can be carried out through carbonization sulfuration [72], solvothermal/hydrothermal sulfuration [73], and direct sulfuration of ZIF precursors [74]. Solvothermal/hydrothermal conversion is the most commonly used method for selenidation or sulfuration due to its high conversion efficiency, economic benefits, and environmental friendliness. The direct conversion method in solid-state can eliminate the cleaning and drying steps, offering the advantages of simple operation and high crystallinity. The main method of phosphorization for ZIF-derived metal phosphides is solid transformation. NaH2PO2 [75] and triphenylphosphine [76] are frequently used as external sources of phosphorus. Furthermore, Gao et al. have developed a method for phosphorization using phytic acid as an external phosphorus source [55]. This method involves agitated etching in a solution and is both environmentally friendly and easy to operate. The synthesis parameters and properties of ZIF-derived anode materials in PIBs are summarized in Table 1 . The diversification of preparation methods for ZIF derivatives and composites provides a strong foundation for designing and applying ZIF-based PIB electrodes. The optimization of the structure and functionality of the target product can be significantly achieved by modulating the type of metal ions, utilizing the flexibility of organic ligands, and accurately selecting a synthetic strategy based on the desired characteristics of the target material. Etching and high-temperature volatilization steps can be used to prepare porous carbon materials with a high specific surface area. Additionally, heteroatom doping techniques are commonly used to precisely modulate chemical components, further enhancing electrochemical properties through synergistic effects.", "output": {}}

The entire reagents were analytically pure (AR) and utilized without further purification.\nThe morphology and structure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7001F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F). The photochemical reactor was installed on a CEL-GPPCL system (Beijing China Education Au-light Company) with a 300 W Xe lamp. Surface element compositions were investigated using a Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi). Mott–Schottky plots were generated using an electrochemical workstation (CHI Instruments CHI760-1). A vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) (Riken Denshi Co. Ltd) was used to study the magnetic performance of the prepared samples. The absorption spectra were recorded via diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS, HITACHI UV-3900). The content of metal Co was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer). The ultraviolet-visible spectrum of TC was recorded using a UV-2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-18700). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a CHI1030B electrochemical workstation.\nThe magnetic Fe3O4 nanospheres were synthesized according to the previous report.39 Briefly, FeCl3 (0.65 g, 4.0 mmol) and trisodium citrate (0.20 g, 0.68 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL ethylene glycol. Then, 1.20 g of sodium acetate (NaAc) was put into the above mixture under continuous stirring.

Besides, the individual TiO2 sample was also fabricated using a similar procedure of the “Preparation of core–shell structure Fe3O4@TiO2” without adding Fe3O4 nanospheres.\nThe Fe3O4@TiO2–Co photocatalyst was synthesized through a sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduction method. Typically, 100 mg Fe3O4@TiO2 were dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water and combined with a certain amount of CoCl2 at different mass ratios (Fe3O4@TiO2–Co-x%, x is 1, 3, 5, and 7, respectively). After stirring for 30 min, the freshly prepared solution of NaBH4 (0.01 M, 20 mL) was dropped into the above solution and was constantly stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Next, the resulting products were washed with ethanol and deionized water several times and then dried at 60 °C and set aside for further use. Moreover, the composition of Fe3O4@TiO2–Co-x% was determined via ICP-OES (Table S1, ESI†), which is basically consistent with the desired loading level. Moreover, the content of the modified Co in Fe3O4@TiO2–Co-x% was tested via ICP-OES (Table S1, ESI†), which was basically consistent with the expected loading level.\nThe photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples was investigated by degrading TC in water. In a typical experiment, 20 mg of photocatalysts was suspended in 100 mL of TC aqueous solution (50 mg L−1). The above mixture was continuously stirred for 30 min in the dark to reach equilibrium. Next, the mixture was subsequently illuminated using a 300 W Xe lamp (full-spectrum) for different time intervals under mechanical stirring. Then, a small amount of the above reaction solution was extracted at various irradiation times and separated using a magnet to remove the photocatalysts, and the upper clear layer was determined by recording the maximum absorbance of TC at 357 nm using a UV-vis spectrophotometer.

Briefly, 2 g Ti3AlC2 was added to 65 mL solution of HF (40 wt%) and stirred at 40 °C for 72 h. The solution was centrifuged and underwent multiple washings to achieve a neutral pH. The resulting precipitate was then dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 12 hours. The MXene was mixed into a suitable quantity of DMSO solution and stirred for 24 h, followed by thorough rinsing with ethanol and DI water and ultrasonically expanded for 3 h after drying. After the completion of the reaction, multiple layers of Ti3C2Tx MXene were immersed in a 10 mol·L−1 KOH solution and stirred for 7 days. The Alk-Ti3C2Tx MXene were obtained through centrifugal washing and vacuum oven drying. 2.3 Synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles The CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. FeCl3·6 H2O (0.5766 g), Co(NO3)2·6 H2O (0.3104 g) and sodium citrate (1.8816 g) were dissolved in 64 mL DI water and agitated for 30 minutes. Urea (0.5760 g) and polyacrylamide (0.4800 g) were dissolved in the solution and stirred violently for 1 h. After that, the mixture was transferred to an autoclave with a 100 mL Teflon lining and dried for 12 hours at 200 °C. After cooling, the sample was centrifuged, repeatedly cleaned with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, and dried for 12 hours at 70 °C in a vacuum oven. The finished product was then milled into a fine powder. 2.4 Synthesis of CoFe2O4@Alk-MXene The CoFe2O4@Alk-MXene composite catalyst was prepared by electrostatic self-assembly method. The CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were immersed in CTAB solution (2 g/L) for 3 h to make it positively charged, washed with ethanol and dried. Then, the positively charged CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and Alk-MXene were added to 30 mL DI water, sonicated for 2 h, and vacuum dried at 70 °C. To investigate the impact of various configuration ratios on TC degradation, the composite catalysts CoFe2O4@Alk-MXene were synthesized with different mass ratios (1:2, 1:1, 2:1) and labeled as CM-0.5, CM-1 and CM-2, respectively. 2.5 Catalytic degradation experiments The catalytic degradation experiments were carried out in a 50 mL beaker at room temperature, where the pH of the solution adjusted using 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M H2SO4 solutions. Specifically, 8 mg CoFe2O4@Alk-MXene catalyst was added to a 40 mL TC-HCl solution with a concentration of 10 mg/L, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes following ultrasonication for 1 minute to achieve adsorption equilibrium. The degradation process commenced by adding 1 mM PMS. The reaction was quenched using 0.5 mL of methanol as soon as 2 mL of the reaction solution, filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter, was obtained at predetermined time intervals. All experiments were repeated and analyzed using mean values. The impacts of TC initial concentration, PMS dosage, inorganic anions and initial pH on the removal of TC were investigated to reveal how these factors affect the degradation of TC by CoFe2O4@Alk-MXene composite catalyst activated PMS. To assess the stability and practicality of the catalyst, the aqueous solution was centrifuged and washed post-degradation experiment, dried in a vacuum oven, and the catalyst was retrieved for further use. 2.6 Catalytic analytical method The ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer was used to determine the absorbance of the filtrate at the maximum absorption wavelength (357 nm) of TC, and the degradation effect of TC was analyzed. The removal efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride was calculated by Eq. (1). (1) Degradation efficiency % = C 0 − C t C 0 × 100 % where C0 is the initial concentration of TC, and Ct is the concentration of TC at the corresponding reaction time t. To explore the active species and the potential catalytic removal mechanism of TC in the CoFe2O4@Alk-MXene composite catalyst, free radical capture and EPR analysis tests were conducted. The catalytic reaction system was supplemented with methanol (MeOH), tert-butanol (TBA, purity 99 %), p-benzoquinone (p-BQ), and L-histidine as scavengers of •OH/SO4 •¯, •OH, O2 •¯ and 1O2 respectively to observe the catalytic performance of TC.

Lithium sheets are purchased from China Energy Lithium (Tianjin) Co., LTD. 2.2 Synthetic procedures Synthesize of CSC700 cathode: 1 g of DHBS was first placed in a tubular furnace and calcined in argon atmosphere for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Then it was cooled to room temperature, rinsed with deionized water for several times and dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the target material CSC700. CSC600 and CSC800 can be obtained by changing the calcination temperature of the DHBS to 600 °C and 800 °C respectively, and keep other conditions remained. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements In the three-electrode system, Pt wire and Ag/AgCl are used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All potentials of this study was translated into standard hydrogen electrode. The LSV test for OER are measured from 0.2 to 0.8 V at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The LSV test for ORR are measured on a rotating disc electrode from −0.80 to 0 V at 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in O2 -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, along with iR compensation. 2.4 Batteries assembling The fabricated CSC600, CSC700 and CSC800 were used as cathodes of Li–O2 batteries. The cathode was sysnthysized by mixing 90 wt% the obtained material and 10 wt% PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) into N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to make a slurry. The slurry is dispersed on carbon paper as a cathode and dried in an oven at 80 for 12 h. The weight of catalyst material at each cathode is about 0.4 mg. All cells were assembled in a glove box in an Ar atmosphere with lithium sheet as anode, a glass-fiber separator, and 1.0 M TEGDME with LiCF3SO3 electrolyte.

In details, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (AR, > 99 %), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (AR, > 99 %), Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (AR, > 99 %) and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O (AR, > 99 %) precursors and anhydrous citric acid (AR, > 99 %) were dissolved in deionized water with 1 h constant stirring at room temperature (Mole ratio: Ni2++Cu2+: Ca2+: Zr4+ = 1: 9: 1; cation: C6H8O7: H2O=1: 1: 40; x: y = 10: 0, 9: 1, 7: 3 or 5: 5). The solution was then evaporated by stirring at 90 ◦C until it formed a viscous gel and then dried at 130 ℃ overnight. Finally, the gel was pounded and calcined in a muffle furnace at 700 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. For experimental control, a Ni-free catalyst and a Zr-free catalyst were synthesized by the same method, denoted as Cu-CaZr and Ni9Cu1-Ca, respectively. 2.2 Catalysts characterization The phase composition of Ni x Cu y -CaZr was investigated using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, MiniFlex 600) and wide-angle diffraction data were recorded within the scope of 10-90°. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were performed on ASAP 2020 to evaluate the microstructural properties of the samples after vacuum degassing at 150 ◦C for 4 h. Specific surface area and average pore volume were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model. Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 X-Twin) tests and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, X-Max) were applied to probe the nanoscale morphology. The actual Ni and Cu content of the prepared materials were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy(ICP-OES, Agilent 5800). The valence distribution of the elements in the samples was tested using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Escalab 250Xi). The reducibility of the materials was investigated by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and CH4 temperature-programmed reduction (CH4-TPR) using a chemisorption analyzer (BCD-Chem C200). CaLDRM process mechanism probed by in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transforms spectroscopy (DRIFTS, Bruker Nicolet 380). 2.3 ICCU-DRM performance All ICCU-DRM tests were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor equipped with an online gas analyzer (Gasboard-3100, Hubei Ruiyi)for real-time monitoring of gas concentrations. The total gas flow rate was 100 mL·min−1. Typically, 0.3 g of powder was reduced at 600 °C in 10 % H2/N2 for 2 h, followed by N2 purge to eliminate H2 from the pipeline and equilibrated to test temperature (600 °C, 625 °C and 650 °C) in this atmosphere. For the CO2 capture stage, 10 % CO2 was equilibrated in N2 for 60 min with 6.7 % O2, consistent with flue gas. In order to investigate the effect of O2 concentration, 0 %, 3 %, and 10 % concentrations of O2 were also tested in separate experiments. For the DRM stage, 2.5 % CH4/N2 was fed for 3 h, and the end of the reaction time was signaled by the absence of CO in the outlet gas. Cycling experiments were performed by repeating the CO2 capture and DRM stages. A 5-minute N2 purge step was taken between each gas switch to avoid direct contact with the reaction gas.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Preparation of Mg/Ni electrode and ZnO/TiO2 composite The chemical reagents used in the experiments were purchased from Aladdin Industry Co., Ltd. or Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. The reagents are analytical grade and are not further purified. Preparation of the Mg/Ni electrode: AZ31 Mg alloy sheet with a dimension of 2.0 × 3.0 × 0.2 cm3 was firstly polished by SiC sandpapers (1200 grit), washed by redistilled water, and sequentially degreased in an acetone solvent and an alkaline solution. Then, the substrate was successively pickled and activated in a phosphoric acid solution (≥ 85.0%, 400 cm3·dm−3) and hydrofluoric solution (≥ 40.0%, 350 cm3·dm−3), respectively. After that, the sample was immersed in a preheated electroless nickel plating bath for 2.0 h, followed by washing and drying, magnesium alloy with nickel‑phosphorus (NiP) layer was obtained, that is, Mg/Ni electrode. The compositions of the solutions and reaction conditions for pretreatment and electroless nickel plating of Mg alloy are summarized in Table S1. More details can also be found in our recent publications [7,22–24]. Pretreatment of Ti foil: A high-purity Ti foil was successively sonicated in acetone, anhydrous ethanol, and deionized water for 20 min to remove grease and contaminants on its surface. After rinsing with a large amount of distilled water, the Ti foil was ultrasonically etched in a chemical polishing solution consisting of NH4F (0.45 g), H2O (2.5 mL), H2O2 (6.0 mL), and HNO3 (6.0 mL) for 30 s to remove the oxide film layer on the surface. Finally, the pretreated Ti foil was rinsed with redistilled water and stored in anhydrous ethanol. Preparation of TiO2 photoanode: TiO2 photoanode was prepared through potentiostatic anodization in an electrochemical cell with a two-electrode system consisting of a Pt foil as the counter electrode (cathode) and the pretreated Ti foil as the working electrode (anode). The two electrodes were immersed in an electrolyte composed of 37.0 mL ethylene glycol, 2.5 mL deionized water, and 0.22 g NH4F at a distance of 3.0 cm. A voltage of 60 V was provided for anodization by an electrophoresis device (DYJ-2, Sangli, China). After anodization for 1.0 h, the sample was cleaned several times using deionized water and ethanol to remove the residual solution. Then, the specimen was annealed at 450 °C for 2.0 h in a tube furnace at a heating rate of 5.0 °C min−1 to produce an anatase phase TiO2 nanotube array. Preparation of ZnO/TiO2 composite photoanode: The composite was prepared by depositing ZnO on the TiO2 nanotube surface using hydrothermal synthesis. A solution (35 mL) containing 50 mM Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 50 mM hexamethylenetetramine was poured into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, followed by placing an anodized TiO2 foil. The autoclave with the foil was transferred into an oven, heated, and reacted at various temperatures (65, 95, 125, and 155 °C) for 4.0 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was taken out and rinsed with distilled water to remove residual chemicals on the surface, followed by heating to 350 °C for 1.0 h in a tube furnace at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. After cooling to room temperature, the as-prepared samples were named ZnO/TiO2–65, ZnO/TiO2–95, ZnO/TiO2–125, and ZnO/TiO2–155, respectively. The preparation process of the ZnO/TiO2 photoanode is schematically shown in Fig. 1 . 2.2 Morphological, structural, and compositional characterizations of the fabricated nanomaterials The surface morphologies and microstructures of the TiO2 and ZnO/TiO2 photoanodes were obtained by a field emission scanning electron microscope coupled with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS, ZEISS Sigma300, 10 kV, Germany) and an HRTEM (FEI Tecnai G2 F30, America). An X-ray diffractometer (XRD, DX-2700 BH, Haoyuan, China) was used to identify the crystallographic structure of TiO2 and ZnO/TiO2 with a scan speed of 5° min−1 in the diffraction angle (2θ) range of 5–85°. An XPS instrument (250xi, Thermo ESCALAB, America) was employed to analyze the compositions and chemical states of the elements and the valence band potential (E VB) of the semiconductor. The light absorption performance and band gap information were acquired by an ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectrometer (UV–vis, UV3600, Shimadzu, Japan) in the 200–800 nm wavelength range. A surface area analysis instrument (BET, Quantachrome NOVA1000e, America) based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller mode was used to evaluate the specific surface areas of the ZnO/TiO2 photoanodes. 2.3 Photoelectrochemical and PCP performance measurements All photoelectrochemical tests, including EIS, Mott-Schottky, OCP over time (OCP-t) curves, current density over time curves (j-t), and current density over potential (j-E) curves, were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Gamry, Interface 1010E, America) through a three-electrode system in an electrochemical cell (Fig. S1). The three-electrode system consists of a photoanode as the working electrode, a Pt foil as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The EIS were tested in a frequency range of 100 kHz - 0.01 Hz with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV in dark and under visible light. The Mott-Schottky curves were measured under dark in an electrolyte containing 0.1 mol L−1 Na2S and 0.2 mol L−1 NaOH at a potential frequency of 1.0 kHz in the potential range of −0.8 to 1.0 V, while the OCP-t and j-t curves were acquired under intermittent visible light . The j-E curves were measured from the potential range of −1.0 to 1.0 V with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 under intermittent visible light (interval: 5 s) in a 0.2 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution. A xenon lamp with a UV cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used to provide a visible light illumination with a power density of 150 mW cm−2 (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.). The PCP performances of the photoanodes were measured by a two-cell (photoelectrode and corrosion cells) device with a salt bridge (Fig. S1). The photoanode was placed in the quartz glass photoelectrode cell containing a solution of 0.1 M Na2S and 0.2 M NaOH, while the Mg/Ni electrode was soaking into the corrosion cell containing a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution [25]. The tests of PCP performances include EIS spectra and curves of OCP-t, j-t, and Tafel of the Mg/Ni electrode coupling with ZnO/TiO2 photoanode under intermittently visible light irradiation. The EIS test was carried out with a frequency range of 0.01 Hz-100 kHz and a perturbation potential of 5.0 mV. The Tafel curves were obtained in the potential range of ±0.5 V relative to the OCP with a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1. All the electrochemical tests were performed after different standing times until a stable OCP was achieved. The EIS spectra and Tafel curves were fitted using the Gamry Echem Analyst software.", "output": {"MAT2": {"name": "TiO2", "Syns_method": "anodization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "NH4F", "amount": "0.22 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H6O2", "amount": "37.0 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "2.5 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "anodize", "parameters": {"voltage": "60 V", "time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "450 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "ZnO/TiO2", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "50 mM"}, "prc2": {"name": "hexamethylenetetramine", "amount": "50 mM"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "solution", "amount": "35 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "65°C, 95°C, 125°C, 155°C", "time": "4 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "350 °C", "time": "1 h"}}}}}}}

Porous carbon, as a widely utilized adsorbent with a broad pore size distribution spanning from small micropores to large macropores, is unsuitable for the selective adsorption of gases with very small molecular size, such as hydrogen. Although this adsorbent is relatively low-cost, ordered porous carbons offer promising advantages by leveraging the advantages of carbon-based adsorbents to achieve uniform pore size distribution and high specific surface area, enabling more selective and rapid separation while minimizing pressure drop and allowing for easy regeneration. This work reviews the use of templated ordered porous carbons produced using hard templating with commonly employed templates, such as silica, zeolites, and open framework materials such as metal organic frameworks, for hydrogen storage applications. The synthesis methods and operating parameters that impact the properties of the final product are evaluated in this study, and a brief comparison with soft-templated carbons is also provided. Based on available literature, the hydrogen adsorption properties of hard-templated carbons are explored, including effective operating conditions and parameters and the underlying adsorption mechanisms.\nGraphical abstract", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "hard-templated porous carbons", "application": "hydrogen storage", "props": {}}, "MAT2": {"name": "soft-templated carbons", "application": "hydrogen storage", "props": {}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "The designed synthesis of an S-scheme heterojunction has possessed a great potential for improving photocatalytic wastewater treatment by demonstrating increased the photoredox capacity and improved the charge separation efficiency. Here, we introduce the fabrication of a heterojunction-based photocatalyst comprising bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) and bismuth-based halide perovskite (BHP) nanosheets, derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Our composite photocatalyst is synthesized through a one-pot solvothermal strategy, where a halogenation process is applied to a bismuth-based metal-organic framework (CAU-17) as the precursor for bismuth sourcing. As a result, the rod-like structure of CAU-17 transforms into well-defined plate and nanosheet architectures after 4 and 8 h of solvothermal treatment, respectively. The modulation of the solvothermal reaction time facilitates the establishment of an S-scheme heterojunction, resulting in an increase in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of rhodamine B (RhB) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The optimized BiOCl/BHP composite exhibits superior RhB and SMX degradation rates, achieving 99.8% degradation of RhB in 60 min and 75.1% degradation of SMX in 300 min. Also, the optimized BiOCl/BHP composite (CAU-17-st-8h sample) exhibited the highest rate constant (k = 3.48 × 10−3 min−1), nearly 6 times higher than that of the bare BHP in the photocatalytic degradation process of SMX. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency can be endorsed to various factors: (i) the in-situ formation of two-components BiOCl/BHP photocatalyst, derived from CAU-17, effectively suppresses the aggregation of pristine BHP and BiOCl particles; (ii) the S-scheme heterostructure establishes a closely-knit interfacial connection, thereby facilitating efficient pathways for charge separation/transfer; and (iii) the BiOCl/BHP heterostructure enhances its capacity to absorb visible light.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are extensively used in electronic devices and are becoming increasingly important for storing renewable energy. Improving the efficiency of LIBs can decrease dependence on fossil fuels and promote a more sustainable energy future. Recently, titanium (Ti)-based anode materials have garnered significant attention as a potential alternative to graphite anodes due to their excellent properties, including high safety and impressive cycling stability. However, Ti-based anodes suffer from poor rate performance because of their low electronic and ionic conductivities. One effective strategy to enhance the rate capability of Ti-based anodes involves creating composites with various conductive materials. MXenes, as novel two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, have gained popularity in various applications due to their remarkable characteristics. Recent studies indicated that MXenes may function as highly effective anode materials for LIBs, owing to their distinct characteristics such as a layered architecture, outstanding electrical conductivity, and hydrophilic properties. Furthermore, MXenes can significantly enhance the electrochemical properties of traditional anode materials for LIBs by forming MXene-based composites. This review aims to comprehensively examine the most notable recent studies on MXenes/TiO2, MXenes/ lithium titanate (LTO), and MXenes/titanium niobate (TNO) nanocomposite anodes. Most of the performed works are on the MXenes/TiO2 nanocomposites and few studies have focused on the compositing of MXenes with LTO and TNO materials. The performed studies have shown that the synthesis parameters (such as temperature, and mass ratio of the composite constituents), and the properties of the MXenes (such as type of MXenes, interlayer spacing, and functional groups) are the most influencing factors on the properties of the MXenes/Ti-based nanocomposite anodes for LIBs.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "In this work, ultraviolet irradiation was employed to assist in the preparation of a novel photocatalyst composite in the form of carbon dots/zeolite-4A/TiO2, using coal tailings as the source of silicon-aluminum and carbon. The composite was designed for the degradation of methylene blue under 500 W of UV light irradiation. Zeolite-4A was used as a support for the well-dispersed carbon dots and TiO2 nanoparticles. The as-prepared composites were subjected to thorough characterization, confirming the successful formation of zeolite-4A with a cube structure, along with the loading of TiO2 and coal-based CDs in the composites. The experimental results demonstrated that the UV-CZTs nanocomposites exhibited a remarkable removal efficiency of 90.63% within 90 min for MB. The corresponding rate constant was exceptionally high at 0.0331 min−1, surpassing that of the Dark-CZTs and pure TiO2. This significant enhancement was possibly due to the synergistic effect of adsorption photocatalysis of the UV-CZTs, combined with the excellent electron-accepting capabilities of the coal-based CDs, which led to highly improved charge separation. An investigation of the spent photocatalyst's recyclability revealed that it retained a remarkable 82.94% MB removal efficiency after five consecutive cycles, signifying the stability of the composite. Trapping experiments also elucidated the primary reactive species responsible for MB degradation, which were identified as photo-generated holes and ⸱O2 − species. By this process, the hydroxyl radicals generated in the system successfully promoted the transformation of coal tailings to coal-based zeolite and coal-based CDs. Coal-based zeolite served as an excellent carrier of titanium dioxide, which improved its dispersibility. The inhibition of e−-h+ recombination of titanium dioxide by introducing coal-based CDs improved the photocatalytic ability of titanium dioxide.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental 2.1 Material preparation The mesoporous LiMn2O4 spinel was synthesized using nano-casting technique with ordered mesoporous silica (KIT-6, Nanjing Xianfeng Nano) as the hard template [29]. Specifically, 0.013 mol of LiNO3 (99%, Macklin) and 0.026 mol of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (98%, Macklin) were dissolved in 10 mL distilled water. Then the solution was added slowly to a 160 mL n-hexane (GR, Kemiou) with 3.5 g of mesoporous SiO2 under a 400 r/min mechanical stirring. The resulted mixture was stirred for 1 h and treated by ultrasound for 2 h. After filtration, the solid was dried at 60 °C for 5 h, and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C or 900 °C for 3 h in the air. The heating rate of calcination was 1 °C/min. The resulting materials were treated with 2 mol/L NaOH solution for 12 h twice at 80 °C to remove the silica template, and then washed with water and dried at 60 °C. The resulted samples, calcined at 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C or 900 °C, are marked as Meso-600, Meso-700, Meso-800 or Meso-900, respectively. As a comparison, the bulk mesoporous LiMn2O4 spinel was synthesized. The mixture, 0.013 mol of LiNO3 and 0.026 mol of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O in 10 mL distilled water, was precalcined in a muffle furnace at 480 °C for 3 h in air with a heating rate of 1 °C/min. Then the obtained powder was ball milled for an hour and calcined in a muffle furnace at 700 °C for 3 h in air with a heating rate of 1 °C/min. 2.2 Electrode fabrication The flat electrodes for linear scanning voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were prepared by a coating method. First, active material (mesoporous or bulk LiMn2O4 spinel), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, MW 534000, 99%, Rhawn), acetylene black powder (ACB, 50% compressed, 99+%, Alfa Aesar) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, AR, Kemiou), at a ratio of 8:1:1:100, were mixed and stirred for 24 h. Then, the obtained slurry was coated on the surface of carbon paper (Toray 090) uniformly by a scraper with a 1 mm gap. The obtained electrode has an area of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm coated with active materials and an area of 0.5 cm × 2.5 cm remained with no active materials to clamp the electrode. The electrode was dried at 60 °C for 3 d and 80 °C for 1 d to remove the NMP solvent completely. The typical mass load of the active material was about 12.8 mg/cm2. The LiMn2O4 flat electrodes were lithium removed to λ-MnO2 in 1 mol/L NaCl at 0.9 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) before adsorption isotherms and kinetics test. The 3D flow-through electrodes were prepared by the impregnation method. The graphite felt (GF, Beijing Sanye Carbon Co.) was washed in ethanol with ultrasound before use. The active material, PVDF, acetylene black powder and NMP, at a ratio of 8:1:1:400, were mixed and stirred for 24 h into a slurry. Then, 1 mL of the obtained slurry was dropped into a 2 cm (length) × 1 cm (width) × 2 cm (height) graphite felt, and the graphite felt electrode was dried at 80 °C for 10 h. This dropping-drying procedure was repeated another 3 times. The typical mass load of the active material on the 3D graphite felt electrode was about 40.0 mg/cm3. The modified electrode was marked as a LiMn2O4@GF electrode. Lithium removed 3D electrode, marked as λ-MnO2@GF electrode, was prepared by the same method and then lithium removed in 1 mol/L NaCl at 0.9 V vs SCE before used. 2.3 Materials and electrode characterization The morphology, structure, and composition information of electrodes were characterized by field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100F), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8-Focus), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher, K-Alpha+), and Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA LabRAM HR, 532 nm excitation wavelength), respectively. The surface areas and pore size distributions were calculated by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Conta Instruments, Autosorb-iQ2-MP) with 300 °C degas pretreatment for 6 h. The electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4 spinel was tested by an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 4000, AMETEK. Inc.) with a three-electrode system at 25 °C. The three-electrode cell includes a 3 cm × 3 cm platinum electrode as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and a LiMn2O4/λ-MnO2 spinel flat electrode as the working electrode. Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were conducted in 60 mL 1 mol/L LiClO4 solution. The potential range of CV measurement was between 0.4 V and 1.1 V. The adsorption test was performed in simulated brine containing 150 mg/L Li+, 1000 mg/L Mg2+, 1000 mg/L Na+ and 1000 mg/L K+ (21.61 mol/L LiCl, 41.15 mol/L MgCl2, 43.48 mol/L NaCl and 25.58 mol/L KCl), which is close to the lithium concentration range of most salt lakes in China [8]. The concentration of Li+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+ was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (ThermoFisher Scientific, iCAP7400). In this study, the adsorption capacity is defined as Eq. (1): (1) q = C 0 − C e V m where C 0 and C e (mg/L) represent the initial and final concentrations, respectively; V is the total volume (L) of solution; m is the mass of the active material. The separation efficiency of Li+ and other ions was calculated as Eq. (2): (2) α = C Li / C M t C Li ′ / C M ′ 0 where α Li-M is the separation coefficient of Li+ and Mn+ (Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+); C Li is the concentration of Li+ in recovery solution (mg·L−1) at t time; C M is the concentration of Mn+ in recovery solution (mg·L−1); C′ Li is the initial concentration of Li+ in source solution (mg·L−1); C′ M is the initial concentration of Mn+ in source solution (mg·L−1). The specific energy consumption for lithium extraction is defined as the electrical energy consumed to extract 1 mol of Li+ from the brine to the recovery solution, shown as Eq. (3): (3) W = M Li ∫ 0 t U t I t dt 3.6 qm where W is specific energy consumption, Wh/mol; q is the adsorption capacity, mg/g; m is the mass of the active material loaded on one electrode, g; M Li is the molar mass of lithium, 6.941 g/mol; U(t) is the cell voltage, V; I(t) is the current of the cell, A; t is the extraction time, s. 2.4 Semi-continuous Li recovery procedure A small-scale flow-type lithium recovery system was constructed as shown in Fig. 1 . The electrolytic cell was separated by an anion-exchange membrane (AEM, TRJAM, TingRun Membrane Tech.) into two chambers. An electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 4000, AMETEK. Inc.) was used as the potentiostat. The electrode which absorbed lithium from brine at the first cycle was defined as the positive electrode. At the initial state, the positive chamber was filled by the λ-MnO2@GF electrode to selectively absorb lithium, while the negative chamber was filled by the LiMn2O4@GF electrode to release lithium. Two streams of solution enter the cell, evenly separated by channels, and then flow through the GF electrode. For good electrical contact, the 3D electrodes adhered to the current collector with conductive carbon glue (mass ratio of PVDF:ACB:NMP = 3:4:93.3) [30]. An SCE served as a reference electrode was inserted into the negative chamber to control the potential of the negative electrode. Another SCE was inserted into the positive chamber to monitor the potential of the positive electrode. The simulated brine for the lithium extraction test was the same as described above, and the recovery solution contains 100 mg/g Li+ (14.41 mol/L LiCl). The concentration of Li+ was measured by ICP-OES. The system was operated under a constant potential mode (potential of 0.2 V vs SCE for lithium intercalation and potential of 0.9 V vs SCE for lithium deintercalation). 0.2 V and 0.9 V vs SCE are the lower and upper limits of the potential window without side reactions, respectively. The determination of the potentials for lithium intercalation and deintercalation was described in SI part 2. The simulated brine and the recovery solution were stored in 500 mL tanks outside the cell. First, the positive electrode worked as a cathode and the negative electrode worked as an anode. The simulated brine was supplied to the positive chamber while the recovery solution was supplied to the negative chamber using a peristaltic pump. Control the potential of the negative electrode to 0.9 V vs SCE for 10 min, while the positive electrode would be automatically polarized to the appropriate potential for lithium adsorption. To avoid introducing impurity cations, a flushing step was needed [31]. Pump air to empty the solution in both chambers and flush the positive chamber with deionized water for 10 min to remove the impurity ions remaining in the GF electrode. The details about the flushing step are shown in SI part 14. Then, the positive electrode worked as an anode and the negative electrode worked as a cathode. Supply the brine to the negative chamber and the recovery solution to the positive chamber. Then control the potential of the negative electrode to 0.2 V vs SCE for 10 min, while the positive electrode would be automatically polarized to the appropriate potential for lithium desorption. Then the chambers were emptied again and the negative chamber was flushed with deionized water for 10 min. The cell voltage and the positive electrode potential were measured with additional digital recording voltmeters. The current was measured by the electrochemical workstation.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "LiMn2O4", "Syns_method": "nano-casting", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "LiNO3", "amount": "0.013 mol"}, "prc2": {"name": "Mn(NO3)2·4H2O", "amount": "0.026 mol"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "10 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "C6H14", "amount": "160 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "5 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "600–900 °C", "time": "3 h", "heating rate": "1 °C/min"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "treat with NaOH", "parameters": {"reagent": "NaOH", "concentration": "2 mol/L", "temperature": "80 °C", "time": "12 h × 2"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "wash and dry", "parameters": {"solvent": "H2O", "temperature": "60 °C"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "bulk LiMn2O4", "Syns_method": "ball milling and calcination", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "LiNO3", "amount": "0.013 mol"}, "prc2": {"name": "Mn(NO3)2·4H2O", "amount": "0.026 mol"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "10 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "pre-calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "480 °C", "time": "3 h", "heating rate": "1 °C/min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ball mill", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "700 °C", "time": "3 h", "heating rate": "1 °C/min"}}}}}}}

Herein, we propose a consecutive resting-output current embedding-lithium process to recover retired LIBs. Specifically, the spent LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode materials can be directly regenerated via a widely applicable aqueous electrolysis process combined with spontaneous lithium migration, driven by concentration polarization, and targeted electrically-driven lithiation, which possesses advantages in reaction time and current utilization efficiency. Besides, lithium salts in the whole process are recyclable, and no side reaction occurs. Furthermore, detailed electrochemical kinetic analysis under different processes, tested by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel, illustrates that both the pre-liquid phase transfer step and electrochemical reaction process dominate the lithiation rate in the rest process, then taken over by the chemical reaction step after applying the output potential. Benchmarking analysis presents that a high current utilization efficiency (more than 90%) is maintained during output current, proving the significant economic advantages of the method, and the regenerated LiFePO4 cathode displays an excellent discharge capacity of 135.2 mA h g−1 at 1 C, with a capacity retention rate of 95.30% after 500 cycles.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "LiFePO4 cathode", "application": "cathode material in lithium-ion batteries", "props": {"discharge capacity": "135.2 mA h g-1 @ 1 C", "capacity retention rate": "95.30% after 500 cycles"}}}}

This increase indicates that new electron transport paths emerged within the composite thanks to RGO, that a significant reduction was achieved in the back-transfer of electrons and that recombination mechanisms were suppressed.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "TiO2-RGO", "application": "photoanode for liquid junction quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs)", "props": {"electron lifetime": "four times longer than pure TiO2"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "pure TiO2", "application": "photoanode", "props": {}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental details 2.1 Materials Commercial titanium alloy plate (Ti-6Al-4 V, TC4) was purchased from China BaoTi Co., Ltd. Nitric acid (HNO3, 65−68%) was supplied by Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent, China. Anhydrous ethanol (C2H6O2, 99%), hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 96%) were provided by Chongqing Chuandong Chemical Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. Silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99.8%) and melamine (C3H6N6, 99%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the chemical reagents were at AR level. 2.2 Construction of titanium alloy surface coating Titanium alloy plates were placed in a Teflon lined autoclave containing 5 M sodium hydroxide solution at 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the samples were washed with deionized water and dried, denoted as HT-TC4. HT-TC4 plates were placed at the bottom of beaker containing 5 mL silver nitrate with a concentration of 0.1 mM. After ion exchange for 1 h at dark environment, the samples were cleaned with deionized water for 60 s. Then the surface of samples was dried and irradiated under UV lamp (254 nm, 5 W) for 1 h, denoted as 60Ag-TC4. HT-TC4 and 60Ag-TC4 were placed on a metal mesh on the top of the ceramic coat containing 0.5 g melamine. Another ceramic coat was placed on the samples and was wrapped with the Al foil. The samples were heated at 550 °C for 40 min with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. After cooling to room temperature, the samples were taken out and marked as 0.5CN-TC4 and 0.5CN/60Ag-TC4, respectively. 2.3 Characterization The morphology of the sample surface was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-7800F). The crystal structure of the coating was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu, XRD7000) with Cu Kα as the radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). The chemical composition and chemical state of the coating were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi). The work function of the coating was determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with He Iα (hν = 21.22 eV) as the light source. The water contact angle of sample surface was measured by using a dynamic contact angle goniometer (Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technology Equipment Co., Ltd., JC2000D). Electrochemical tests were carried out on a workstation (AutoLab, model PGSTAT 302 N) with three electrode system. The light source was 500 W xenon lamp, and the light intensity was 110 mW/cm2. The UV-Vis absorbance of samples was measured by diffuse reflectance method by using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR), and BaSO4 was used as reflection sample. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to measure the hydroxyl and superoxide radicals with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as active species trapping agent (EMX Nano, Bruke). 2.4 Evaluation of antibacterial properties S. aureus (ATCC 25,923) and E. coli (ATCC 25,922) were used to evaluate the antibacterial performance. All samples were put into a 24 well culture plate, and then the bacteria solution was diluted to 1 × 107 colony forming units (CFU)/mL with phosphoric acid buffer solution (PBS, hyclone, SH30256.01), thereafter the bacteria solution (1 ml) was inoculated to the surface of the sample. During the culture period, the full-time opening of all-optical halogen lamp (Eden, 70 W) was maintained, and the vertical distance between the light source and the culture plate was 55 cm. The culture temperature was 37 °C. For the dark test, the plate was covered with tin foil paper to avoid light. At the end of the culture period, the bacteria around the sample were gently sucked, and then were rinsed three times with PBS. Thereafter the bacteria on the sample surface were fixed overnight with 3% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C, and then the samples were dehydrated with ethanol of different concentrations (25, 50, 75%, 100%, vol/vol) for 10 min. After the samples were dried, the bacterial distribution on the surface was observed by SEM. For the long term antibacterial performance test, the TC4 samples coated with and without TiO2/AgNPs/g-C3N4 were co-cultured with E. coli under light irradiation for 3 and 7 days, respectively. During this period, the culture plate was put into the incubator at 37 °C and the culture medium was added for every two days. The bacterial distribution on the surface was then observed by SEM. Meanwhile, the TC4 samples coated with TiO2/AgNPs/g-C3N4 were immersed in PBS without bacteria under light irradiation for 0 and 3 days. Thereafter, the chemical composition and chemical state of samples were characterized by XPS. 2.5 Cell cultivation and biocompatibility MC3T3-E1 subclone 14 cells were purchased from the cell bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences. The cells were cultured in a constant temperature incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) with essential medium as nutrient. The essential medium was prepared by adding 10 vol% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sijiqing, 11,011–8611) and 1 vol% penicillin streptomycin mixture (GIBCO, 15,140,122) into the basic medium (α-MEM, hyclone, SH30265.01). When the cells proliferated to 80−90%, they were trypsinized and harvested by centrifugation, and then were suspended and diluted to the desire density in culture medium. All samples were evaluated for cytotoxicity using the 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]−2, 5-diphenylterazolium bromide (MTT) assay (MTT Cell Proliferation and Cytotoxicity Assay Kit, Beyotime Biotechnology, China). Firstly, the samples after UV sterilization were immersed in the centrifuge tube with culture medium for 48 h, and the volume of culture medium used for each sample was 5 mL. 1 × 104 cells were inoculated into 48 well plates (culture medium 0.5 mL cell density 2 × 104 cells/well). After 24 h, the culture medium in the culture plate was replaced by the extract of each sample group. The negative control group was added with complete culture medium without soaking treatment, and was cultured for different time (24, 48, and 72 h) according to the experimental plan. At the end of each culture cycle, 100 μL MTT reagent (0.5 mg/mL) was added to the well and cultured in the incubator in dark for 4 h. After the incubation, the supernatant was carefully removed, and then 200 μL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. The crystal was dissolved by shaking for 15 min. Finally, 100 μL mixed solution and 96 well plate were sucked. The absorbance of each well was determined by 570 nm wavelength with the help of microplate reader.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "0.5CN-TC4", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal treatment and heat treatment", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "NaOH", "amount": "5 M"}, "prc2": {"name": "melamine", "amount": "0.5 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal treatment", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "6 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "550 °C", "time": "40 min"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "0.5CN/60Ag-TC4", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal treatment, Ag ion exchange, UV irradiation, and heat treatment", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "NaOH", "amount": "5 M"}, "prc2": {"name": "AgNO3", "amount": "0.1 mM"}, "prc3": {"name": "melamine", "amount": "0.5 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "5 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal treatment", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "6 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ion exchange", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}, "substances": [{"name": "AgNO3", "amount": "0.1 mM"}]}, "post_proc3": {"step": "UV irradiation", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "550 °C", "time": "40 min"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Considering the extensive research studies on Ru and Mo2C for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the construction of heterostructure catalysts containing both Ru and Mo2C nanoparticles can further improve the catalytic activity by the synergistic effect of different species. In this work, we report the synthesis of N,P co-doped carbon coated Ru and Mo2C nanoparticles for the HER using a ZnMo metal–organic framework (MOF) as the precursor. The addition of phosphomolybdic acid during the synthesis of a Zn-MOF not only provides a Mo source for the formation of Mo2C, but also induces a nano-bowl structure. After anchoring RuCl3 in the ZnMo-MOF and thermal annealing, Ru and Mo2C nanoparticles encapsulated in N,P doped carbon (Ru–Mo2C@NPC) were synthesized and the nano-bowl morphology was well preserved. Due to the co-existence of the highly active catalytic species Ru and Mo2C, a large specific surface area owing to the evaporation of Zn during the calcination process, and the nano-bowl-like morphology that boosts mass transfer, Ru–Mo2C@NPC exhibits good catalytic activity for the HER over a wide pH range, with overpotentials of 62, 64 and 170 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS solution at 10 mA cm−2, surpassing the values for many Ru and Mo2C based catalysts.

Iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 99%), chloramphenicol (CAP, 98%), tetracycline (TC, 99%), kanamycin sulfate (KAN, 99%), ampicillin trihydrate (AMP, 98%), ciprofloxacin (CIP, 98%), streptomycin sulfate (STR, 98%), amoxicillin (AMX, 98%), penicillin G (PG, 98%) and enrofloxacin (ENR, 98%) were purchased from Shanghai Maclin Biochemical Co., LTD. GDY was provided by Jiangsu Xianfeng Nanomaterials Technology Co., LTD. Potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl), manganese sulfate (MnSO4), copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Reagent Co., LTD. Hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter membrane (0.45 µm) was purchased from Haining Delv New Material Technology Co., LTD. Deionized (DI) water was used for all aqueous solutions. 2.2 Experimental instruments The morphology and structure of the materials were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Talos F200X). The crystal structure was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). The valence states of the elements were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB Xi+). Electrochemical tests were carried out on CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., LTD.) using a three-electrode system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is measured at −1.0 to 0 V, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) is measured at −0.9 to −0.4 V, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is measured at open potential in a frequency range of 1000 kHz−0.01 Hz. All electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.1 M PBS. Work electrode (WE): GCE, reference electrode (RE): Ag/AgCl, counter electrode (CE): platinum (Pt) wire. 2.3 Synthesis of Fe-MOF Fe-MOF was synthesized using a hydrothermal method on the basis of a previous report with some modifications [26]. In general, 374.3 mg Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 374 mg NH2-DBC were added to 30 mL DMF. The mixture was stirred magnetically at 60 °C for 2 h. The evenly mixed solution was then transferred to a 50 mL Teflon high-pressure reactor for 20 h at 120 °C. After the reaction, the precipitation was washed 3 times separately with methanol and water to remove unreacted impurities. Finally, the obtained Fe-MOF was dried at 60 °C for 24 h. 2.4 Synthesis of Fe-MOF@GDY Firstly, Fe-MOF solution (1.0 mg·mL−1) was prepared by dispersing Fe-MOF (1 mg) in 1 mL mixture of DI water and ethanol (1:1, v/v) with ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. Similarly, GDY (1 mg) was dispersed in 1 mL aqueous ethanol (1:1, v/v) and treated with ultrasound for 10 min to obtain 1.0 mg·mL−1 GDY solution. Then, the assembly of GDY and Fe-MOF into Fe-MOF@GDY nanocomposite was carried out by mixing Fe-MOF and GDY solution at a volume ratio of 1:1 under mild ultransonication for 10 min, followed by magnetically stirring at 300 rpm for 24 h to obtain Fe-MOF@GDY(1:1). In the same way, Fe-MOF@GDY(1:2) and Fe-MOF@GDY(2:1) with volume ratios of 1:2 and 2:1 were prepared accordingly. 2.5 Fabrication of Fe-MOF@GDY-Based electrochemical sensor Before modification, the GCE surface was ground with 0.05 µm alumina slurry on a polishing cloth for 10 min until the surface was smooth. The polished GCE was ultrasonic cleaned in DI water and ethanol, and dried with nitrogen for use. Finally, 5 μL Fe-MOF@GDY aqueous solution and 3 μL Nafion were mixed and dropped on the surface of GCE. The Fe-MOF@GDY/GCE was used for electrochemical characterization. For the detection of CAP in groundwater, Fe-MOF@GDY aqueous solution and Nafion were mixed and dropped on the WE of SPE (RX3004-0001). The SPE is assembled with a filter paper, making the filtration and detection of water samples are integrated. The SPE can match with a portable electrochemical detection module (Biosys) and transmit the electrochemical signal to the smartphone through Bluetooth. 2.6 Detection of CAP in Lake water samples The water samples were taken from the Stone Lake in Suzhou. For the CAP recovery experiments, all water samples undergo a pretreatment to remove impurities through a hydrophilic PTFE filter membrane. For recovery experiments, different concentrations of CAP were added into the treated water samples, making the final CAP concentrations were 1.0 × 10−10 mol·L−1, 1.0 × 10−7 mol·L−1, 5 × 10−4 mol·L−1, 1.0 × 10−2 mol·L−1, respectively.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Fe-MOF", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal method", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe(NO3)3·9H2O", "amount": "374.3 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "NH2-BDC", "amount": "374 mg"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMF", "amount": "30 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "2 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "20 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Fe-MOF@GDY", "Syns_method": "assembly", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe-MOF", "amount": "1 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "GDY", "amount": "1 mg"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "1 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "1 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ultrasonic", "parameters": {"time": "10 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "24 h"}}}}}}}

Fig. 1(b) shows PCM structure-1 (D1), the front and back surfaces of the battery surrounded by 20 mm thermal insulation layers, and the side surfaces of the battery in contact tightly with tin boxes that are filled with PCM. The heat generated during charge-discharge process can be absorbed by PCM. Fig. 1(c) illustrates PCM structure-2 (D2): the battery is surrounded by the PCM layer. Furthermore, Fig. 1(d) illustrates the schematic diagram of the experimental setup for measuring the thermal performance of PCM modules. A battery cycler (NWEARE CT-4004-10V100A-NFA) controlled by a computer was employed to charge/discharge the battery. Each battery was discharged with constant current until the voltage decreased to the cutoff voltage, then the battery was charged using the constant current/constant voltage method after 30 min of rest. All experiments were conducted in the laboratory at around 30 °C. Four K-type thermocouples with a diameter of 0.5 mm were attached to the middle ( T 1 ) , the position near the anode pole ( T 2 ) , the position near the cathode pole ( T 3 ) and the side center ( T 4 ) of the battery to measure the temperatures. Additionally, two thermocouples were used to measure the temperatures of the PCM ( T P ) and the copper plate ( T c o p ) , respectively. The data were recorded by the temperature acquisition module. As shown in Table 2 , test group 1 was conducted to explore the thermal performance of batteries without PCM at different charge-discharge rates. Test groups 2–4 were carried out to investigate the thermal management performance of PCM under several detailed factors to optimize the battery thermal management. 2.3 Concept description and theoretical background Generally, the heat generation of the battery Q g e n during charge and discharge contains two parts: reversible and irreversible heats [10,34,35]. The entropy change is responsible for the reversible heat ( Q i r r ), and the irreversible heat ( Q r e v ) is the heat generated by ohmic resistance [32,36]. Q g e n can be expressed as Eqs. (1)–(3). The irreversible heat Q r e v varies with the charging and discharging processes, its value is positive during discharge and negative during charge. (1) Q g e n = Q i r r + r e v (2) Q i r r = I 2 R (3) Q r e v = I T b d E O C d T The temperature of the battery is affected by various heat transfer paths. To reduce the battery temperature, the heat generated by the battery during charge/discharge can be transferred through PCM. Fig. 2 presents the heat dissipation paths of the heat produced by the battery in the presence of PCM. The heat removed by the PCM ( Q P ) includes four heat transfer paths, which is expressed as Eq. (4). q 1 is the heat absorbed by the PCM, which consists of the heat capacity of the PCM and the latent heat absorption. q 2 is the convection heat transfer between PCM and environment, q 3 is the convection heat transfer between copper plate and environment, and q 4 is the heat absorbed by the copper plate. According to Newton's law of cooling, q 1 , q 2 , q 3 and q 4 can be estimated by Eqs. (5)–(8). (4) Q P = q 1 + q 2 + q 3 + q 4 (5) q 1 = m P C P ( T P − T ∞ ) + γ m P Δ H (6) q 2 = ∫ h ¯ P A P ( T P − T ∞ ) d t (7) q 3 = ∫ h ¯ c o p A c o p ( T c o p − T ∞ ) d t (8) q 4 = m c o p C c o p ( T c o p − T ∞ ) In order to get the values of q 2 and q 4 , it is necessary to calculate the average heat transfer coefficient ( h ¯ ). According to Ref. [37], h ¯ can be calculated by Eq. (9), where L are the geometric characteristic lengths of the PCM and the cooper plate, and N u ¯ is the average Nusselt number. N u ¯ determined by the flow state of the air can be calculated by Eq. (11). The Reynolds number (Re), a key parameter used to determine whether the airflow is laminar or turbulent, is expressed by Eq. (11). (9) h ¯ = N u ¯ k L (10) N u ¯ = { 0.664 R e 1 / 2 P r 1 / 3 R e ≤ 5 × 10 5 ( 0.037 R e 4 / 5 − 871 ) P r 1 / 3 R e > 5 × 10 5 (11) R e = u L ν", "output": {}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Analytical-grade chemical reagents were all utilized without additional purification. Aldrich supplies the following: potassium iodide KI (99%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), ethylene glycol (100%), indigo carmine (99%), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB, 98%), and titanium tetra-isopropoxide (99%). Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China, supplies ciprofloxacin, C17H FN3O3, with a purity >98.0%. 2.2 Synthesis of materials 2.2.1 Fabrication of TiO2 Sol-gel was applied to manufacture TiO2 in the following manner: First, 11.7 ml of titanium tetra-isopropoxide and 12.2 ml of ethanol were combined at ambient temperature with frequent stirring while 5 ml of 0.05 M CTAB was present. After adding 35 mL of 0.2 M acetic acid and 100 mL of ionized water to the mixture above, it was continuously stirred for an hour until a gel originated. Overnight, the gel-like mixture was kept at room temperature. The mixture underwent filtering, 110 °C drying, and 3 h of 450 °C heating. 2.2.2 Fabrication of Sulfated-TiO2 After 2 h of vigorous stirring and 1 h of ultrasonication, the produced TiO2 was combined with 50 mL of 2.0 M H2SO4. Following multiple rounds of filtration and distilled water washing, the mixture was dried for 6 h at 120 °C and then calcined for 2 h at 400 °C. ST was the sample's designation. 2.2.3 Fabrication of BiOI Solution A was created by dissolving 0.03 mol of Bi(NO3)3.5H2O in 35 mL of ethylene glycol while being vigorously stirred and ultrasonicated for 15 min in order to prepare BiOI. 25 mL of ethylene glycol were combined with 0.03 mol of KI, and the mixture was shaken and ultrasonicated for 15 min, forming solution B. After that, solution A was added to that of B. The resulting mixture was poured into a 200-mL steel autoclave lined with Teflon and baked for 12 h at 160 °C. After producing a precipitate, it was repeatedly cleaned with ethanol and deionized water before being dried at 60 °C. 2.2.4 Fabrication of BiOI/sulfated TiO2 BiOI/sulfated TiO2 nanocomposite with different ratios of BiOI on sulfated TiO2 (namely 5, 10 wt%) was prepared through three steps: First: dispersion A was prepared, which consisted of 0.7 g of the obtained sulfated TiO2 dispersed in 100 ml of distilled water under stirring. Second: To form 5 wt%, a certain amount of BiOI was added to solution An under intensive blending for 1.5 h then ultrasonicated for 1h. The resulting mixture was then filtered, bathed many times with water, and then desiccated for 12 h. Finally, the product was heated at 200 °C for 2 h. It is denoted as 5BOST. The same procedures were done to prepare 10 wt% BiOI/ST and denoted as 10BOST. While another sample was prepared using sulfate free TiO2 to synthesize 10 wt% BiOI/TiO2 that was denoted as 10BOT. 2.3 Catalytic activity measurements The catalytic activity was studied on two models of pollutants, namely dyes and pharmaceutical products. Using the fabricated nanomaterials, the photocatalytic oxidation of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) and indigo carmine dye (IC) was examined as shown in Fig. S1. To 0.05 g of the photocatalyst, 50 ml of indigo carmine dye or ciprofloxacin solution (20 ppm) was applied. Before radiation, the reaction mixture was agitated for 30 min. A 150 W LED visible light lamp (PCX50C, Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd.) was utilized with a special UV cut off filter (λ = 420 nm) offering a visible light source. A 1 ml portion of the suspension was taken out at periodic times and tested for ciprofloxacin or indigo carmine dye content. A Shimadzu spectrophotometer was used to evaluate the absorbency of the ciprofloxacin and indigo carmine dye spectrophotometrically at 610 and 275 nm, respectively. However, the relationship below was used to assess the photocatalytic effectiveness: = ( 1 − C C o ) × 100 (1) A Mettler-Toledo instrument was used for calculating the total amount of organic TOC carbon. All measurements were carried out three times. P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, and C. albicans were tracked to determine the toxicity of the control CIP as well as when combined with the photocatalysts. The well-plate approach, also known as the diffusion method, was used to monitor antibacterial and antifungal activity (Mousa et al., 2013). The spore suspensions of the examined organisms, which included Candida albican (Can. A.), gram -ve bacteria (Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), Escherichia coli (E. Coli)), gram + ve bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and, were made in previously sterile and checked inoculating flasks, each of which held 50 ml of previously and checked medium. In order to allow for adequate diffusion, the petri dishes were first incubated at 5 °C for 2 h. After that, the test organisms for bacteria were placed in an incubator at 37 °C for 48 h and for fungi at 30 °C for 72 h. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C for bacteria and 72 h at 30 °C for fungi, antimicrobial activity was detected. The inhibitory zones were measured in mm. 2.4 Characterization All materials under investigation were subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the crystalline phases using a JDX: 8030 X-ray, JEOL, made in Japan. To execute the patterns, Cu-filtered CuKα radiation (λ ≥ 1.5418 Å) was powered at 45 kV and 10 mA. The specimens underwent testing at room temperature, within the range of 2θ = 10 and 80°. Using a KBr pellet, the specimens' FTIR spectra were evaluated on a Bruker-TENSOR Series FTIR-Germany device. Utilizing a 200 kV speed voltage transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G20, USA), the HRTEM pictures of the obtained samples were analyzed to determine their surface morphologies. Following monochromatic Al-Kα irradiation, the produced catalysts' binding energies estimates were adjusted using C1s (284.6 eV) and assessed with a KRATOS-AXIS DLD spectrometer. The SCALAB 250Xi system measured valence band XPS (VB-XPS). The surface area (SBET), pore volume, and pore radius were determined after being vacuum-treated for 2 h at 100 °C using nitrogen sorptiometry using a micromeritics ASAP 2020 Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System device at 77 K. The Shimadzu UV–Vis spectrophotometer (2600i UV–Vis, Japan) was used for recording UV–Vis diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) in the 200–800 nm range using BaSO4 as a standard. To evaluate the PL emission bands, a thermoscientific Lumina-brand fluorescence spectrophotometer was utilized. 2.5 Computational study The computations were conducted employing density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP functional and a 6–31G (d, p) basis set for the geometry optimization of CIP and IC molecules. The Gaussian 09 code was utilized to simulate the behavior of adsorbate molecules (Gaussian, 2009). Energy values of the lowest molecular orbital that was unoccupied (ELUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) were used to estimate the electronic characteristics and reactivity of the compounds under study. The quantum chemical parameters were calculated using specific equations(Amrhar et al., 2023; Dagdag et al., 2020): (2) Δ E g a p = E L U M O − E H O M O (3) η = Δ E g a p 2 , σ = 1 η (4) χ = − ( E H O M O + E L U M O ) 2 (5) μ = ( E H O M O + E L U M O ) 2 (6) ω = μ 2 2 η Grimme DFT-D was integrated into the Dmol3 module of Materials Studio (MS) software, and the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient assumption (GGA) functionality was used to optimize the geometry of anatase TiO2 and BiOI (Oyesakin et al., 2009). Using a double numerical plus (DNP) polarization basis set and a real-space orbital global cut-off of 4.4 Å, density functional semi-core pseudopotentials were fitted to each electron (Perdew et al., 1996). A 5 × 5 × 5 K-mesh was employed for optimization. The optimized structure obtained from the Dmol3 output was held at the (0 0 1) surface and replicated in a 5 × 5 × 1 direction to create a supercell. BiOI was loaded onto the TiO2 (001) surface with a concentration of 10.66%. Additionally, the ST (001) surface loaded with 8.27% and 13.09% of BiOI was tested. The adsorption location element of the Materials Studio program was used in the Monte Carlo model to determine the ideal adsorption arrangement of one molecular structure (CIP and IC) on the BiOI/TiO2 and BiOI/ST surfaces and to compute the appropriate adsorption energies (Akkermans et al., 2015). A 30 Å gap was inserted throughout the z-axis of the supercell that was built in order to lessen the impact of periodic replication. Subsequently, the adsorption system, incorporating the optimized molecule, underwent geometric optimization using the Smart algorithm (Oxide et al., 2018) with the universal force field (Han et al., 2016). Electrostatic interactions were addressed through the Ewald summation method, while the atom-based summation method was applied to handle van der Waals interactions (Xu et al., 2015). The adsorption energies for these molecules were calculated using the following equation: (7) E a d s = E m o l e c u l e / s u r f a c e − E s u r f a c e − E m o l e c u l e Where E m o l e c u l e / s u r f a c e , E s u r f a c e , and E m o l e c u l e are the total energies of ciprofloxacin and indigo carmine on BiOI/TiO2 and BiOI/ST surfaces, the total energies of BiOI/TiO2 and BiOI/ST surfaces, and total energies of CIP and IC, respectively.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "TiO2", "Syns_method": "sol-gel", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "titanium tetra-isopropoxide", "amount": "11.7 mL"}, "prc2": {"name": "ethanol", "amount": "12.2 mL"}, "prc3": {"name": "CTAB", "amount": "5 mL"}, "prc4": {"name": "acetic acid", "amount": "35 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "12.2 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "CH3COOH", "amount": "35 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "filter"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "110 °C"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "450 °C", "time": "3 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Sulfated-TiO2", "Syns_method": "sulfation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "H2SO4", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "2 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ultrasonicate", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "filter"}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "6 h"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "400 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "BiOI", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Bi(NO3)3·5H2O", "amount": "0.03 mol"}, "prc2": {"name": "KI", "amount": "0.03 mol"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C3H8O2", "amount": "60 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "160 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "filter"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C"}}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "5BOST", "Syns_method": "dispersion mixing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Sulfated-TiO2", "amount": "0.7 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "BiOI", "amount": "5 wt%"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "100 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "1.5 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ultrasonicate", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "filter"}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "200 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}, "MAT5": {"name": "10BOST", "Syns_method": "dispersion mixing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Sulfated-TiO2", "amount": "0.7 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "BiOI", "amount": "10 wt%"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "100 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "1.5 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ultrasonicate", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "filter"}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "200 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}, "MAT6": {"name": "10BOT", "Syns_method": "dispersion mixing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "TiO2", "amount": "0.7 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "BiOI", "amount": "10 wt%"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "100 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "1.5 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ultrasonicate", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "filter"}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "200 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "The uncontrollable dendritic behavior and volume expansion in alkali metal anodes have led to short-circuit issues and low Coulombic efficiency which significantly hamper the commercialization of alkali metal anodes. To address these issues, we report the fabrication of a novel functional host in which the alkaliphilic Cu(OH)2 nanowires were uniformly grown on Cu foam (denoted as Cu(OH)2-NWs@CF) for Li/Na anodes. The 3D network structure of Cu(OH)2-NWs@CF with high specific surface area can not only effectively reduce local current density to guide homogeneous deposition of Li+, leading to more controllable nucleation sites and dendrite-free Li deposition, but also minimize the volumetric strain during repeated Li/Na stripping/plating processes, mitigating the volume change of the batteries. Benefitting from these advantages, the as-prepared Li/Na@CF composite anodes exhibit outstanding long-term cycle stability and structure maintaining ability. In particular, the Li@CF-based symmetric cells deliver elevated cycling performance under a moderate polarization voltage for nearly 1200 h at a current density of 1 mA cm−2.

The SM molecules were loaded into the L, and L/FCN nanocarriers by an anion exchange process, and then the 3 synthesized nanoparticles (L, SM-L, and SM-L/FCN) were characterized. Based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PD) tests' outcomes, the maximum corrosion prevention efficiency (about 90.88 %) belongs to the SM-L/FCN nano reservoir containing saline extract. Additionally, for the epoxy phase, the EIS results (on the intact and scratched specimens) revealed a significant diminish in the chloride and water penetration into the epoxy coating during 63 days of immersion for intact and 24 h for scratched states.

The results of intact coating revealed that the Log (|Z|0.01 Hz) value reached 10.63 in long immersion time indicating a decreased occurrence of coating disbondment attributed to the electrolyte infiltration and corrosion of the underlying metal substratum. According to the pull-off and cathodic disbonding tests results, there was an enhancement in adhesion (51.5 % decrease in loss of adhesion strength, & a 52 % decline in diameter of cathodic disbondment), and a strong interaction between the interface of epoxy and substratum.

Equalisation management is essential for reducing the difference between battery cells, improving capacity, and prolonging the cycle life. Passive equalisation is also widely used in electric vehicles and energy storage systems because of its comparative advantages including the low cost, simple structure, and easy control. Compared with the mature development of the passive equalisation hardware circuits, the evolution of high-performance equalisation strategies is relatively backward. Along these lines, a multiple time scale state-of-charge (SOC) and capacity-based equalisation strategy for lithium-ion battery packs with passive equalisers was proposed in this work. Firstly, the minimum-capacity differential model (MCDM) consisting of a cell minimum-capacity model (CMCM) and a cell differential model (CDM) was established to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the dynamic behaviour of the minimum-capacity cell, as well as all the other cells in a battery pack. Secondly, the SOC and capacity of a battery pack were estimated on multiple time scales with the use of a dual extended Kalman filter and MCDM. The fast time scale based on CMCM and the slow time scale based on CDM can balance the efficiency and accuracy of the estimation algorithm. Based on the accurate estimation of both SOC and capacity, a SOC-and-capacity-based equalisation strategy was designed. Finally, a high-fidelity multicell model was used to simulate and verify the proposed equalisation strategy under the guidance of actual battery pack degradation data. The extracted experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently and accurately estimate the SOC and capacity of new and aged batteries while a high-accuracy estimation in the entire life cycle is achieved.

The CF was then dried under N2 stream and immersed in a mixture solution of 10 mol L−1 NaOH and 1 mol L−1 (NH4)2S2O8 for 0.5 h. After the reaction, the product was further rinsed with DI water and dried under vacuum at 60 °С for 6 h. The Cu(OH)2-NWs@CF was obtained after calcining at 180 °С in air for 2 h. Finally, the Li/Na@CF electrodes were prepared by coating excess molten Li/Na onto the surface of Cu(OH)2-NWs@CF at 300 °С in an Ar-filled glovebox. 2.2 Sample characterization The structures of Cu(OH)2 nanowires formed on Cu foam and Cu host were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 phase with Cu Kα radiation with λ = 1.54059 Å). The morphology of the as-prepared materials prior and after electrochemical processes was monitored by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Zeiss Gimni-300). Note that the recycled lithium anode was initially obtained in an Ar-filled glove box, and the residual Li/Na salts and solvents were removed with acetonitrile. 2.3 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical measurements were conducted using CR2032-type coin cells assembled in an Ar-filled glove box. The half cells consisted of Cu foil, Cu foam, or Cu(OH)2-NWs@CF as the working electrode and Li foil as the reference electrode. In order to obtain a stable SEI and remove any impurities or contaminations on Li metal surface, the assembled batteries were pre-cycled for 5 times from 0.01 to 1 V under the current density of 0.02 mA g−1. Subsequently, 2 mA h cm−2 of Li was plated onto bare Cu foil, bare Cu foam, and Cu(OH)2-NWs@CF, which were then charged to 1.0 V (vs Li+/Li) at 0.5 mA cm−2 or 1.0 mA cm−2 for Li stripping in each cycle using a LAND CT2001A battery system. The Coulomb efficiency (CE) was determined by calculating the ratio of lithium deposition capacity to stripping capacity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out on a CHI-760E workstation (Shanghai, China) with an amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency ranged between 100 kHz and 0.01 Hz. The long-term cycling stability test of Li stripping/plating on different host materials was conducted using symmetric cells with two identical electrodes, and meanwhile, the control group cells were fabricated with two pristine lithium foils. The electrolyte used in the batteries contained 1 mol L−1 LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC, volume ratio of 1:1) solution without any additives. The performance of Li@CF was determined using full cells that were assembled with LFP cathodes and the as-prepared anodes. The LFP cathode homogeneous slurry was prepared by mixing the active material, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and super P at a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), which was then casted onto an Al foil current collector followed by drying under vacuum at 80 °C for 36 h prior to assembly. In the full cells, the Li@CF composite electrodes and pristine lithium foils were both used as anodes. The cell assembly procedures for long-term cycling stability test of Na stripping/plating were the same as those for Li mentioned previously except for the use of sodium foils. The electrolyte contained 1 mol L−1 NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (EC/DMC/EMC, volume ratio of 1:1:1) solution with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additives.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Abstract\nLi-S batteries are widely studied due to their superior theoretical energy density. However, the “shuttle effect” on the cathode and the unstable Li metal anode hinder their practical application. During cycling, the “shuttle effect” leads to severe self-discharge and accelerates the capacity decay. Moreover, the shuttled polysulfides aggravate the growth of dendrites and the loss of Li, causing a low Coulombic efficiency. Considering electrolyte plays a crucial role in the polysulfides solvation behavior and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)-formation process, a well-designed electrolyte is required. Here, we report a local high-concentration electrolyte for Li-S batteries. This electrolyte is prepared by adding “diluent” 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether (TME) to the conventional electrolyte. The reduction of free solvent in the Li-ion solvation sheath suppresses the dissolution of the polysulfides, and more anion-derived SEI can be formed. Our work simultaneously restrains the “shuttle effect” of the cathode and builds a stable SEI on the anode to protect the Li metal. Without any LiNO3 additive, the average Coulombic efficiency of the Li anode can reach 98.87% after 120 cycles, and Li-S batteries with superior capacity retention of 60% after 400 cycles at 0.5 C can be achieved.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "local high-concentration electrolyte", "application": "for Li-S batteries to suppress polysulfide shuttle effect and stabilize Li metal anode", "props": {"Coulombic efficiency": "98.87% after 120 cycles", "capacity retention": "60% after 400 cycles @ 0.5 C"}}}}

Chlorpyrifos (CPS), diazinon (DZN), hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, ferric chloride dehydrate (FeCl3.6H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ammonium oxalate (AO), Hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)), benzoquinone (BQ), isopropanol (IPA), acetone, carbon disulfide (CS2), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), ethanol, 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (H2BDC), 2-propanol, N-(2-Aminoethyl)-3-(aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (AEAPTMS), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and dimethylformamide (DMF) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. Acetonitrile of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade and deionized water were purchased from Merck, Germany. Magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) were obtained from Iranian nanomaterials with specifications including purity of 98%, specific surface area of 40–60 m2/g, spherical morphology, and black color. 2.2 Synthesis of Fe3O4@SiO2/PAEDTC@MIL-101 (Fe) According to Fig. 1 , 1.5 g of magnetic nanoparticles were immersed in 0.2 M hydrochloric acid solution for modification and then washed with distilled water until neutralization. The reason for immersing nanoparticles in acid is to remove impurities present on the surface and pores of Fe3O4 particles for suitable interaction with SiO2 and LDH. After this, 1 g of nanoparticles was added to the mixture containing 250 mL of distilled water, 75 mL of methanol, 4 mL of ammonium hydroxide, and 3 mL of TEOS under a stirrer. After 8 h, nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation and washed with methanol and water to remove impurities. Next, the formed Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles were added to a volumetric flask of methanol under mixing. After 1 h, 1 mL of AEAPTMS was added to the flask, and the mixture was stirred for an additional 15 h. The Fe3O4@SiO2-EN particles were separated by the magnet and treated with acetone/methanol. After these steps, 1 g of nanoparticles was immersed in a flask containing 2-propanol (150 mL), 1 M sodium hydroxide (3 mL), and CS2 (2.4 mL) for 4 h. Finally, Fe3O4@SiO2/PAEDTC was separated by the magnet and washed with water/methanol until neutralization of the pH of the catalyst surface. For the synthesis of Fe3O4@SiO2/PAEDTC@MIL-101 (Fe) core-shell nanoparticles, two solutions, A and B, containing different compounds were prepared. For solution A, 2 g H2BDC was dissolved in 100 mL DMF, and for solution B, 1.0 g Fe3O4@SiO2/PAEDTC and 6.76 FeCl3.6H2O were dissolved in 80 mL DMF. Next, solutions A and B were transferred to the Teflon autoclave at 115 °C for 20 h. The formed core-shell nanoparticles were separated by a magnet, washed with distilled water/ethanol, and dried at room temperature (Firoozichahak et al., 2022; Xing et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2016). 2.3 Photocatalytic experiments The photocatalytic activity on the degradation of CPF and DZN was evaluated in a 0.2 L beaker containing 100 mL of pesticides and catalyst, all under stirring. The UV light source was placed at a distance of 5 cm from the reaction vessel and the pH of the solution was adjusted with 0.1 M sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide. The effect of operating parameters, such as initial pH (3–11), photocatalyst dosage (0.1–1 g/L), pollutant concentration (10–100 mg/L), and UV light intensity (8–36 W), on the degradation of CPS and DZN was studied by photocatalysis reactor. The evaluation of the parameters' effects was conducted by varying one factor while keeping other parameters constant for testing. During the successive reactions, a portion of the sample was withdrawn from the reactor to measure the residual concentration of pesticides. Recyclability tests of Fe3O4@SiO2/PAEDTC@MIL-101 (Fe) were investigated by performing the steps of reaction, washing, and reuse. The reactive species produced in the photocatalytic reactor were determined by adding 10 mM IPA, Cr (VI), AO, and BQ. 2.4 Analytical methods The surface morphology and analysis of the synthesized semiconductor compounds were determined through scanning electron microscope (SEM, TESCAN mira3: Czech Republic), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM30, Netherlands), and energy dispersive X-ray analysis-mapping (EDX-mapping). The crystalline structure of the sample was determined through an X-ray diffractometer (Xpert PRO MPD, Northland) with a Cu Kα X-ray source. The sample magnetization was analyzed by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, MDK Kashan, Iran) with a maximum field of ±10 kOe. To confirm the magnetic property of the sample, a magnetic field around the reaction reactor was used. Texture characteristics, such as specific surface area, diameter, and pore volume of the samples, were determined by Brunaeur, Emmett and Teller analysis (BET, BELSORP- mini Ⅱ, Japan). HPLC device with C-18 column and UV–visible detector was used to measure pesticide concentrations. Acetonitrile and water with a volume of 50/50% were used as the mobile phase, and the phase flow rate was 1 mL/min. Total organic carbon (TOC) was measured by a TOC analyzer. The initial and final concentrations of COD were studied through the standard method based on colorimetry and UV–visible spectrophotometry. In this method, 2 mL of wastewater sample was added to a COD vial containing a mixture of oxidants, and then the sample was digested for 2 h at 150 °C. The COD concentration was measured using a DR-5000 at a specific wavelength. BOD5 measurement was carried out using a BOD meter (BD 600). For analysis, a certain amount of sample containing nutrients and bacteria was added to both the initial and final solutions, and changes in the BOD value after 5 days were determined using the device. Mineralization tests were performed at pH = 5 and pollutant concentration = 100 mg/L in a period of 120 min for nanocomposite dose equal to 0.6 g/L.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Fe3O4@SiO2/PAEDTC@MIL-101 (Fe)", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe3O4", "amount": "1 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "TEOS", "amount": "3 mL"}, "prc3": {"name": "AEAPTMS", "amount": "1 mL"}, "prc4": {"name": "H2BDC", "amount": "2 g"}, "prc5": {"name": "FeCl3·6H2O", "amount": "6.76 g"}, "prc6": {"name": "NaOH", "amount": "3 mL"}, "prc7": {"name": "CS2", "amount": "2.4 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "250 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "CH3OH", "amount": "75 mL"}, "sov3": {"name": "NH3·H2O", "amount": "4 mL"}, "sov4": {"name": "DMF", "amount": "180 mL"}, "sov5": {"name": "C3H8O", "amount": "150 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "8 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "15 h", "substances": [{"name": "AEAPTMS", "amount": "1 mL"}]}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "4 h", "substances": [{"name": "NaOH", "amount": "3 mL"}, {"name": "CS2", "amount": "2.4 mL"}]}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "115 °C", "time": "20 h"}}}}}}}

Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM(analysis was performed using a Ziess EM900 instrument to characterize the morphology and particle size of the synthesized ZIF-67. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements was conducted using a PANalytical (XPert Pro MPD) diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The XRD pattern was collected in the 2θ range of 5–80° to identify the phases present and determine the crystal structure of the electrocatalysts. To obtain detailed information regarding the pore volume, pore size distribution, and specific surface area of the ZIF-67, Adsorption-Desorption N2 Porosimetry analysis was carried out using a Belsorp-mini II instrument employing the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Ultraviolet–visible Spectroscopy (UV–vis) measurement was conducted using a PerkinElmer (LQS-ID-006) spectrometer in the wavelength range of 200–700 nm. This technique allowed for the investigation of the light absorption properties and estimation of the band gap. Finally, to verify the bonding and chemical composition of the synthesized ZIF-67, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was performed using a Perkin Elmer-Spectrum65 within the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1. 2.4 Electrochemical characterization The electrocatalytic activity of the ZIF-67 electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was comprehensively evaluated using a three-electrode configuration by an Autolab (PGSTAT302 N) instrument. A glassy carbon (GC) electrode with a surface area of 1 cm2 served as the working electrode, while a platinum plate and a calomel electrode acted as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All experiments were carried out in a 1 M KOH electrolyte solution purged with N2 to eliminate the influence of dissolved oxygen. The working electrodes were prepared via a conventional slurry coating method. A mixture of the synthesized ZIF-67 electrocatalyst powder and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder in a 9:1 wt ratio (0.09 gr: 0.01 gr) was dispersed in 1 mL of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent by ultrasonication for 1 h. The resulting slurry was then drop-casted onto a pre-cleaned GC electrode with a volume of 0.1 mL. Finally, the coated electrodes were dried at 80 °C for 4 h in an oven to remove the solvent. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry were employed to investigate the HER activity and electrochemical behavior of the ZIF-67 electrodes. LSV measurements were performed in an N2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The potential range was from 0 to −0.6 V (vs. RHE) to determine the overpotential required to achieve specific current densities of interest (10, 50, and 100 mA cm−2). The measured potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation (1): (1) ERHE = ESCE + 0.242 + 0.0591 pH Tafel slopes were obtained for the ZIF-67 electrocatalysts by plotting the overpotential (η) versus the logarithm of current density (log (i)) according to the Tafel equation (Equation (2)) to evaluate the reaction kinetics. (2) η = a + b × log (i) Where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, i is the current density, and a represents the exchange current density, i0, which reflects the intrinsic rate of electron transfer. EIS measurement was performed in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz–100 kHz with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV to gain insights into the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The equivalent circuit model of the EIS data was fitted using ZView software. The Cdl of the ZIF-67 electrode was estimated from CV curves in a non-faradaic region (typically between 0.25 and 0.1 V vs. RHE) at various scan rates (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mV s−1). Finally, the stability of the ZIF-67 electrocatalyst for HER was evaluated at a fixed potential corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm−2.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "ZIF-67", "Syns_method": "facile chemical method", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Co(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "0.29 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "C4H6N2", "amount": "0.65 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "age", "parameters": {"temperature": "25 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "centrifuge"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"solvents": ["H2O", "C2H5OH"], "times": "three washes each"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of TiO2/N-CNFs interlayer The TiO2/N-CNFs interlayer for LSBs was prepared through an electrospinning followed by calcination process. Before electrospinning, a precursor solution was prepared by following steps: Firstly, 0.25 g urea was put into a 40 ml weighing bottle, followed by adding 6 ml N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 4.8 ml ethanol and 0.9 g glacial acetic acid under constant stirring. After that, 2.25 g tetrabutyl titanate was added dropwise and stirred for 5 min. Then, 1.125 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, molecular weight 1300000) and 1.6 g acetic acid were added successively with 5 min stirring in each step. After sealing the weighing bottle and stirred at 40 °C overnight, a clear solution was obtained and ready for electrospinning. In the electrospinning process, the as-prepared solution was poured into a 20 ml syringe with a needle diameter of 0.51 mm and fixed on the syringe pump of the electrospinning equipment. The propulsion speed was set as 0.6 ml·h−1 and the rolling receiver was placed 15 cm away with a rolling speed of 400 r·min−1. Under a high voltage of 18 kV, a nanofiber membrane was formed on the receiver, which was peeled off and dried at 60 °C for 30 min. After that, the membrane was cut into 10 cm × 4 cm sheets and placed between two alumina plates for further calcination. Firstly, the membrane was pre-oxidized at 250 °C for 2 h in air atmosphere. Then, the sample was transferred to a tube furnace, heated to 600 °C with a heating rate of 1 °C·min−1 and kept for 2 h under N2 atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the final product was obtained and named as TiO2/N-CNFs. For comparison, CNFs and TiO2/CNFs membranes were also prepared with the same procedures, except that only PVP or PVP with glacial acetic acid and tetrabutyl titanate was used as precursor solutions for electrospinning. 2.2 Preparation of C/S cathode C/S composite was prepared by the melt diffusion method. Firstly, carbon black and sulfur were mixed and ground in a mortar with a mass ratio of 2:8. After that, the mixture was transferred into a 1 ml ampoule bottle and filled with inert gas before sealing. The sealed ampoule bottle was then placed in the oven and kept at 155 °C for 12 h to obtain C/S composite with a sulfur content of ∼80%, which can be quantitatively confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. S1 (in Supplementary Material). For cathode preparation, the C/S composite was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride and acetylene black with a mass ratio of 8:1:1 and ground in a mortar for 30 min, after which N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as solvent was dropped into the mixture to obtain an uniform slurry after stirring for 3 h. The slurry was coated on an Al foil and vacuum dried at 80 °C overnight before cutting into circular cathodes for LSBs with a diameter of 13 mm. 2.3 Material characterization Field emission scanning electronic microscope (FESEM, ZEISS Merlin Compact) and high-resolution transmission electronic microscope (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector were used to observe the microstructure and elemental distribution of the samples. Powder X-ray diffractor (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm) and Raman spectroscope (Thermo Fischer DXR, excitation wavelength: 514 nm) were used to investigate the chemical composition and graphitization degree of the samples.

Li foil with a diameter of 15.6 mm and thickness of 0.45 mm, C/S coated Al foil and Celgard 2600 micro-porous polypropylene membrane were employed as anode, cathode and separator, respectively. Moreover, an extra interlayer (CNFs, TiO2/CNFs or TiO2/N-CNFs) was inserted between cathode and separator as polysulfide inhibitor in this work. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on CHI 670D electrochemical workstation with a scanning rate of 0.2 mV·s−1. Galvanostatic tests were carried out on a LAND CN-2001A battery system in the voltage range of 1.7–2.8 V vs. Li+/Li. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at open circuit voltage with an amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range of 105 Hz to 0.1 Hz. 2.5 Polysulfide trapping measurement The trapping capability for polysulfide was measured using a H-shaped glassware with two chambers divided by an interlayer. One chamber was filled with the deep brown solution of lithium polysulfide (Li2S6), which was prepared by mixing 400 mg Li2S and 23 mg S in 25 ml DOL/DME (1:1 volume ratio) followed by stirring at 50 °C for 12 h. The other chamber was filled with clear DOL/DME solvent. CNFs, TiO2/CNFs and TiO2/N-CNFs were employed as interlayers to separate the two chambers.

The two-phase flow and vibration effects are the two important factors to be considered in practical fuel cell applications because the gas/liquid two-phase flow is a non-negligible threat in acidic fuel cells. In this study, a two-phase flow computational model is developed to investigate the vibration effects on cell characteristics based on a multi-physics coupling process. The model accuracy is validated with the previous experiment. Major results demonstrate that: (1) Vibration intensity and frequency have negative impacts on cell performance owing to the severe fuel crossover and delayed gas phase discharge; (2) Increasing the feed liquid flow rate is a resultful approach to resist the vibration effects, alleviate fuel crossover, and improve the current and power outputs. However, these are achieved at the expense of fuel utilisation and exergy efficiency; (3) Increased contact angle also plays the positive part in decreasing gas phase fraction; (4) The cell performance depends strongly on vibration intensity, and improving the anti-seismic performance of MFC mainly increases the ability of the cell to resist vibration intensity.

DMF, ethanol and distilled water were used as solvents to solubilize the reactants to form highly crystalline material.\n2.2 Synthesis of Cu–BTC and Cu–Zn–BTC\nCu–BTC was synthesized by hydrothermal process [35, 36]. Typically, the solutions were made separately by mixing trimesic acid (1.50 g) in a mixture of ethanol and DMF (45 ml) and CuNO3.6H2O (3.110 g) in distilled water (22.5 ml). The two solutions were mixed and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then put into 100 ml Teflon lined stainless autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. The resulting blue crystals achieved by filtration were rinsed with ethanol and water and dried overnight at 60 °C.\nCu–Zn–BTC MOF synthesis was carried out using modified hydrothermal method [35]. The solutions were prepared by dissolving CuNO3.6H2O (2.53 g) ZnNO3.6H2O (0.47 g) and trimesic acid (1.50 g) in 60 ml mixture (1:1:1) of distilled water, ethanol and DMF and stirred at room temperature. The mixture was heated at 120 °C in 100 ml Teflon lined stainless autoclave for 12 h. The resulting blue solid obtained by filtration was rinsed with ethanol and water and dried overnight at 60 °C in oven and used for further study (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2\nSchematic diagram for synthesis of Cu–Zn–BTC MOF\nFull size image\n2.3 Characterization\nThe prepared adsorbents were characterized using different analytical techniques. The prepared sample’s size and crystallinity was determined by X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The morphology and structural characteristics were measured via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to assess elemental makeup of substance. The applied voltage for SEM and EDX was 15 kV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, 8201C, Shimadzu) with wavenumber (4500–400 cm−1) was used to investigate functional groups of MOF. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was done by thermal graphic analyzer (25–800 °C) with °C/min of heating rate in N2 environment.\n2.4 Adsorption Study\nAdsorption studies of MB dye by Cu–Zn–BTC and Cu–BTC (S2-S6) were performed in a thermostatic shaker bath, and various factors like pH, initial MB concentration, reaction time, temperature and dose were examined. Stock solution (1000 mg/L) of MB was diluted to make different dye concentrations and adjusted their pH by 0.1 M HCl and NaOH solutions. Typically, adsorbent (0.1 g) was added to desired concentration of MB (40 ml) and stirred for 24 h. Afterward, the suspension was filtered and amount of MB dye still present in solution was assessed using UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 665 nm. Removal efficiency and removal capacity of dye adsorbed by adsorbent were determined by following equations.\n$${\\text{Removal efficiency }}\\left( {\\text{\\%}}\\right) = \\frac{{ \\left( {C_{i} - C_{e} } \\right) \\times 100}}{Ci}$$\n (1) \n$${\\text{ Adsorption}}\\,{\\rm{ capacity}}\\; (q_{e}) = \\frac{{\\left( {C_{i} - C_{e} } \\right) \\times V}}{m \\times 1000}$$\n (2) \nwhere qe(mg/g) is equilibrium removal capacity of material; Ci and Ce(mg/L) are initial and final concentrations of dye; V(ml) is volume of adsorbate solution; and m(g) is mass of adsorbent, respectively.\n2.5 Adsorption Isotherms Models\nLangmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms were employed to study the removal phenomenon and examine adsorption mechanism, and these models are represented mathematically by Eqs. (3), (4) and (5), respectively:\n$$\\frac{{C_{e} }}{{q_{e} }} = \\frac{1}{{K_{L} q_{m} }} + \\frac{{C_{e} }}{{q_{m} }}$$\n (3) \n$${\\text{In}}q_{e} = {\\text{In}}K_{F} + \\frac{1}{n}{\\text{In}}C_{e}$$\n (4) \n$$q_{e} = \\frac{{{\\text{RT}}}}{{b_{T} }} {\\text{In}}A_{T} + \\left( {\\frac{{{\\text{RT}}}}{{b_{T} }}} \\right) {\\text{In}}C_{e}$$\n (5) \nwhere qm(mg/g) is maximum uptake capacity and Langmuir adsorption constant is KL (L/mg). Freundlich isotherm constants KF (mg g− 1) (L mg− 1)1/n and n stand for adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity, respectively. The Temkin constants related to heat of sorption and equilibrium binding are bT (J/mol) and AT (L/mg), respectively. Temperature is denoted by K, and R, the gas constant, is 8.314 J/mol K.\n2.6 Adsorption Kinetic Models\nVarious kinetic models like pseudo-first and pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion were applied to determine kinetic mechanism of MB adsorption onto Cu–Zn BTC.\nPseudo-first-order equation is mathematically expressed as:\n$${\\text{ In}}\\left( {q_{e} - q_{t} } \\right) = {\\text{In}}q_{e } - k_{1} t$$\n (6) \nPseudo-second order is represented as:\n$$\\frac{t}{{q_{t} }} = \\frac{1}{{k_{2} q_{e}^{2} }} + \\frac{t}{{q_{e} }}$$\n (7) \nIntraparticle diffusion is presented as:\n$$q_{t } = k_{{{\\text{int}}}} t^{1/2} + C$$\n (8) \nwhere qt(mg/g) is quantity of MB adsorbed at time t, and k1 (min−1), k2 (mg/g min) and kint (mg/g min0.5) are pseudo-first, pseudo-second and intraparticle diffusion rate constants.\n2.7 Desorption and Reusability of Adsorbent\nThe reusability of Cu–Zn–BTC nanocomposite is essential from an economical point of view. For desorption, the adsorbent was heavily loaded with MB by mixing of Cu–Zn–BTC (0.5 g) with 200 ppm of dye solution (100 ml) for 2 h [37]. The adsorbent was recovered after the first cycle by centrifuging it for five minutes and treated with different eluents (NaOH, ethanol, HCl and water). The obtained adsorbent was dried at 60 °C and used for MB adsorption for up to five adsorption cycles. The % desorption was calculated as:\n$$\\% {\\text{ desorption}} = \\frac{{{\\text{Conc}}{\\text{.of dye desorbed by eluent}}}}{{{\\text{Conc}}{\\text{.of dyes adsorbed on adsorbent}}}} \\times 100$$\n (9)", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Cu–BTC", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "BTC", "amount": "1.50 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "Cu(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "3.110 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH and C5H5NO", "amount": "45 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "22.5 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Cu–Zn–BTC", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "BTC", "amount": "1.50 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "Cu(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "2.53 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "0.47 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "20 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "20 mL"}, "sov3": {"name": "C5H5NO", "amount": "20 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C"}}}}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Organic carbonates, especially the unsymmetrical organic carbonates, are important chemical intermediates for functional polymers, lubricant, pharmaceutical syntheses, and have also been widely used as green solvent, additives to fuel, and electrolytes in lithium batteries.70 Traditionally, the synthesis of organic carbonates required the usage of toxic reagents like dimethyl sulfate and phosgene. Recent works have been focused on the development of more simple and eco-friendly routes to synthesize various valuable organic carbonates, mainly involving the design and preparation of highly efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification of dialkyl carbonates with alcohols or carbonic esters to synthesize unsymmetrical carbonates like ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC),71,72 and for the carbonylation of glycerol with urea or carbon dioxide to produce glycerol carbonate (GC).73\nSo far, a variety of metal oxides including supported metal oxides and complex oxides have been tested as solid acid/base catalysts for the synthesis of organic carbonates. Among them, some metal oxides with nanostructures, such as CaO,74 MgO,75 ZnO,76 Mg–La77 and Zn–Al78 and Co–Zn metal oxides,79 exhibited relatively high catalytic activity. However, these nano-sized metal oxides are usually unstable, and leaching of active metal species commonly occurs during the catalytic reaction processes, especially when a high reaction temperature is operated. For example, it has been proved that almost all the liquid-phase carbonylation or transesterification reactions catalyzed by the solid Zn-base catalysts are essentially homogeneous rather than heterogeneous.76,78,80\nFor solving these problems, considerable effort has been devoted to improving the stability of the metal oxide-based catalysts, and some significant progress has already been made by choosing suitable support materials and effective preparation strategies. For instance, Mufsir et al. reported that by using N-doped graphene (NDG) as the support, the resultant ZnCuO/(30%)NDG nanocomposites showed the improved catalytic activity and stability in the transesterification of triglyceride with methanol to produce biodiesel.81 Xiao and co-authors reported that Zn–Co@N-doped carbon materials, which are prepared by pyrolysis of a zeolitic imidazolate framework of Co/Zn-ZIF with a zeolitic imidazolate framework, exhibited high activity and enhanced stability for the transesterification synthesis of EMC.82 In fact, various porous carbon materials containing different N- and O-functional groups have received considerable attention recently due mainly to their great advantages in anchoring or confining various nano-sized or even atomically dispersed metal-based catalysts, which may generate structurally stable nanocomposite catalysts for the application in various important heterogeneous catalytic processes.25,83 In many cases, it has been revealed that the incorporated O-/N-groups could improve the dispersion degree of metal (oxide) through building metal–support interactions, which may also modulate the electron density or the chemical environment of the confined metal (oxide) centers, finally leading to enhancement in the catalytic efficiency and stability for a given catalytic reaction.84–86 Therefore, it can be expected that both the catalytic activity and stability of the carbon supported metal oxide catalysts might be further improved for the liquid-phase synthesis of organic carbonates through precisely controlling the structure and coordination environment of the active metal oxides.\nFor the purpose of obtaining more efficient and stable heterogeneous metal oxide-based catalysts for application in the catalytic synthesis of organic carbonates, we and coauthors also tried to prepare a series of N-doped carbon material (NCM) supported ZnO catalysts (ZnO/NCM-T, where T represents the thermal treated temperature, 600–900 °C) with weak Lewis acidity.87 The self-made NCM support was obtained by a sol-gel method using sucrose, citric acid and hexamethylenetetramine as the carbon/nitrogen resources. In the XRD patterns of ZnO/NCM-T catalysts (Fig. 7A), the diffraction signals belonging to the ZnO crystalline phase are not presented, indicating that the introduced ZnO species are evenly dispersed on the NCM support. With increasing the calcination temperature, the XRD peaks related to graphitic carbon (at around 24° and 43°) are downshifted somewhat, implying that a higher temperature would result in stronger interaction between the highly dispersed ZnO and the graphitic carbon layer in NCM. This point could be further confirmed by the Raman measurement, showing that the defect sites in the NCM support decreases gradually with the increase in thermally treated temperatures. Among them, ZnO/NCM-800 possesses the highest specific surface area (1222 m2 g−1) and largest pore volume (0.98 cm3 g−1) with abundant mesopores. These nice features might be an indication that highly dispersed ZnO may act as an activating agent to create more pores during the high temperature (e.g., 800 °C) treatment process.\nThe XPS results demonstrate the existence of C, O, N and Zn species, revealing the formation of N-doped carbon-based ZnO composite materials. The surface contents of N and O species decline somewhat with increasing the treatment temperatures (Fig. 7B). The N 1s spectra show that nitrogen species are mainly present in the form of pyridinic-N, pyrrole-N, and quaternary N, and the O 1s spectra exhibit the existence of various oxygen-containing groups, including carbonyls, hydroxyl (or ethers), and lactone (or anhydride) groups. These N/O-containing functional groups presented on the surface of NCM supports should be helpful for achieving high dispersion of metal oxides. The Zn 2p spectra show that the chemical environment of the Zn atoms changed somewhat after being supported on the NCM support, confirming further the presence of relatively strong interaction between ZnO and the NCM support (Fig. 7C). The NH3-TPD results shown in Fig. 7D indicate that a certain amount of weak acidic centers are present on NCM supported ZnO catalysts. The two samples of ZnO/NCM-700 and ZnO/NCM-800 possess relatively larger amounts of acidic sites than other samples. Notably, no obvious NH3-desorption signals could be detected on the desorption profile of the ZnO/AC sample, a commercial active carbon (AC) supported ZnO catalyst, implying that the acidic sites presented on ZnO/NCM-T should mainly originate from the interaction between ZnO and the functional groups of the NCM support.\nThe catalytic tests showed that the four ZnO/NCM-T catalysts exhibit relatively high catalytic activity for the transesterification of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with diethyl carbonate (DEC) to produce EMC, much higher than ZnO, NCM and ZnO/AC (Fig. 7E). Among them, the ZnO/NCM-800 catalyst has the highest catalytic activity, giving a 44% conversion of DEC (near from the equilibrium conversion) after 0.5 h reaction. More significantly, ZnO/NCM-800 could be easily recycled several times without an obvious decrease in catalytic activity (Fig. 7F), and no detectable leaching of zinc species occurs during the catalytic reaction process, suggesting the excellent stability of ZnO/NCM-T catalysts.\nIn combination with the above characterization results, it can be proposed that the existing weak acid sites, which are formed through the interaction between ZnO and the surface N-/O-containing groups of the NCM support, should be the main catalytic active centers for the transesterification reaction. Moreover, the surface N-containing species like pyridine-N may also serve as basic sites to synergistically activate the reactants, thus leading to the formation of a highly efficient ZnO/NCM catalyst for the synthesis of EMC through transesterification reaction.\nBy further optimizing the preparation parameters of the N-doped porous carbon (NC) support, the contents of impregnated zinc salts, and the thermally treated temperature (i.e., 600 °C), a novel carbon-based single-Zn-atom catalyst named Zn1/NC could also be obtained, and its catalytic performance was investigated for the carbonylation of glycerol with urea to produce glycerol carbonate (GC), which is thought to be a potential route for transferring industrially surplus biomass-based glycerol to valuable products.88 The support of the NC material was prepared by a similar method as the preparation of a NCM support, just without the addition of hexamethylenetetramine. The Zn1/NC catalyst was obtained by impregnation of Zn(NO3)2 solution on the NC support, following a heating treatment at 600 °C. The formation of atomically distributed Zn species on the NC support can be demonstrated by XRD, TEM, XPS and XAS techniques. For the Zn1/NC catalyst, no obvious characteristic peaks indexed to metallic nanoclusters can be detected and the majority of Zn species are atomically distributed on the whole carbon matrix. The oxidized zinc species and some pyridinic N, carbonyl and acyloxy groups were also present on the surface of the NC support. Meanwhile, it can be inferred that the isolated Zn2+ species should be coordinated with surrounding N- and/ or O-containing functional groups and atomically anchored on the surface of NC support to form a Zn1–N4−xOx(H2O)2 complex with a hexagonal coordination environment, as verified by XANES and EXAFS measurements (Fig. 8A–D).\nCatalytic results demonstrated that the resultant Zn1/NC catalyst has excellent catalytic property and stability for glycerol carbonylation with urea to produce GC, much better than the reference catalyst of NC supported ZnO nanoparticles (Zn-NPs/NC) and the individual Zn(NO3)2 (Fig. 8F). Previous literature results revealed that both Zn(NO3)2 and the supported nanosized ZnO could effectively catalyze the carbonylation reaction after in situ forming a homogeneous zinc isocyanate (Zn NCO) complex, which is the truly catalytic active species for the reaction.73 In the present work, the homogeneous essence of Zn(NO3)2 and Zn-NPs/NC could also be verified by hot-filtration experiments. As for Zn1/NC, it exhibited very high catalytic efficiency under relatively mild reaction conditions (120 °C), showing a 94.8% conversion of glycerol and 95.0% selectivity of GC within a 6 h reaction time, thus resulting in a much higher GC yield (above 90%) than those of the reference catalysts.7,73 In addition, after recycling 5 times, the catalytic activity and selectivity of the used Zn1/NC catalyst still well remained, suggesting the excellent recyclability and stability of the catalyst. The enhanced catalytic activity and stability of the Zn1/NC catalyst should be mainly attributed to the formation of structurally stable single-Zn-atom sites, which are coordinated with the N-/O containing groups existing in the NC support.\nBy using the time-dependent in situ IR spectra to monitor the catalytic reaction process (Fig. 8E and G), it was found that different from the homogeneous Zn(NO3)2 catalyst system, the Zn1/NC system required a much shorter reaction time (without an induction period) to generate the main GC product with less accumulation of intermediate I during the whole catalytic course, which means that the Zn–N/O complex existing on the Zn1/NC catalyst possesses a strong ability to directly adsorb and activate urea, then to react with glycerol to produce GC via an intermediate state. Moreover, the signal-Zn sites should also have excellent structure/chemical stability against the formation of the unfavorable Zn–glycerol complexes, which are often formed over homogeneous zinc salts like Zn(NO3)2 or supported ZnO nanoparticle catalysts.7,73,78\nDFT calculations were further performed to infer the most favorable coordination structure of the Zn–N/O complex on the catalyst of Zn1/NC. This was achieved by calculating the adsorption energies of glycerol and urea molecules at the Zn sites with seven possible models (Zn1–N4−xOx, x = 0–4) (Fig. 8H). As shown in Fig. 8I, the adsorption energy of urea was more significantly lower than that of glycerol over the state of Zn1–N2O2-1 in the broad temperature range of 300–1000 K, implying that the configuration of Zn1–N2O2-1 should be the main catalytically active site of Zn1/NC, which can play a dominant role in preferentially activating urea and preventing the formation of ZnGly. Hence, it can be proposed here that the outstanding catalytic activity and GC selectivity of the Zn1/NC catalyst should mainly benefit from the formation of an appropriate coordination environment for Zn2+ sites provided by the neighboring O- and N-containing groups existing on the NC support.\nThe above results suggest that rationally optimizing the coordination environment of metal oxides or a single atom within functionalized carbon supports may have great potential to develop more efficient and stable nanocomposite catalysts for the catalytic syntheses of unsymmetrical organic carbonates under the milder conditions. Additionally, this work could also provide some meaningful guidance on how to reveal the nature of the catalytically active ZnO nanoparticles or single-Zn sites, which are confined by various O- and N-containing groups on the surface of N-doped porous carbon supports.\n", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "ZnO/NCM-T", "Syns_method": "sol-gel and calcination", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "sucrose", "amount": "unknown"}, "prc2": {"name": "citric acid", "amount": "unknown"}, "prc3": {"name": "hexamethylenetetramine", "amount": "unknown"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "600–900 °C"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Zn1/NC", "Syns_method": "impregnation and heat treatment", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2", "amount": "unknown"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "600 °C"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental 2.1 Materials preparation and characterization YS-ZnO sample was prepared via a hydrothermal-annealing method, in which zinc chloride (ZnCl2, Aladdin, 99.95%) was chosen as the zinc source [52]. For the hydrothermal process, the ZnCl2 and anhydrous glucose (C6H12O6, Aladdin, 99.99%) were dissolved in 60 mL deionized water (DI water) with a mole ratio of 1:5. The pH value of the mixed solution was regulated to ca. 6.0 by using the concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%) and ammonium hydroxide (NH3‧H2O, 28%, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%). Subsequently, the above solution was transferred to the 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and then was heated in a thermal oven with a temperature of 170 °C for 18 h. After cooling down to the room temperature, the black powders were washed separately with enough DI water and absolute alcohol in turn for five times, and then put into a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 20 h. The dried black sample was firstly annealed at 200 °C for 3.5 h in the corner of a tube furnace. And the heating rate should be kept at as low as 1 °C min−1 under argon, after which, the pre-heated sample was transformed in a Muffle furnace and thermally treated at 600 °C in air for 6 h. The YS-ZnO sample was collected for further testing after the Muffle furnace naturally cooled down to 25 °C. The crystallinity and composition of the YS-ZnO sample were analyzed by Micro-Raman spectrophotometer (Renishaw RM 3000), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5600) and Power X-ray diffraction system (XRD, model PW 1825). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL 2010) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL-7100F) were chosen to examine the morphology of the YS-ZnO sample. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping was used to measure the distribution of every element in the YS-ZnO sample. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the YS-ZnO sample was investigated by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption. 2.2 Electrodes preparation and battery measurements Sulfur powder was thermally encapsulated into the YS-ZnO sample at 155 °C for 12 h under argon atmosphere with a mole ratio of 4:1. Then, the sample was heated at 200 °C for 0.5 h under argon atmosphere to evaporate the sulfur on the surface of the YS-ZnO structure, and the obtained composite sample was abbreviated as the S/YS-ZnO. In the control group, the ZnO nanoparticle was used to mix with the sulfur power at the same procedure mentioned above, and this sample was referred as the S/NP-ZnO. The sulfur contents in these composites were tested by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) that was performed on a TGA Q5000 (TA instruments) from the room temperature to 500 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. To prepare the sulfur cathode, the as-prepared samples (S/YS-ZnO and S/NP-ZnO) were mixed with Super P, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) to form a slurry. After ultrasonically stirred for 5 h, the slurry was coated onto the aluminum foil and dried at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The areal sulfur loadings in these prepared cathodes were calculated to be around 3.0 and 6.0 mg cm−1. To evaluate the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrodes, CR2032 corn cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (Etelux, Lab 2000, H2O ≤ 1 ppm, O2 ≤ 1 ppm), which were consisted of the obtained sulfur cathodes with a diameter of 14 mm, the Celgard 2400 membranes with a diameter of 19 mm as the separator, and the lithium metal foil with a diameter of 16 mm as anode. Meanwhile, 30 μL organic electrolyte was added into every cell, in which 1 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%) was dissolved into a mixture of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) and dimethoxymethane (DME, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) with a volume ratio of 1:1. The prepared Li-S batteries were cycled in an 8-channel battery tester (Neware, CT-3008 W) with different current densities at the room temperature with the relative humidity of 30%. To examine the reaction kinetics of the Li-S batteries, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted from 1.7 to 2.8 V (vs. Li/Li+) with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 on a potentiostat electrochemical station (PARSTAT 2273). The adsorption ability of the YS-ZnO sample for LiPSs was detected by the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) adsorption spectroscopy test. Specifically, some YS-ZnO samples were immersed into a diluted Li2S6 solution with a concentration of 0.025 M, which was prepared by dissolving the solid sulfur (S8) and lithium sulfide (Li2S) at a proper mole ratio in the DOL/DME mixed solution under argon atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 1 , a homemade stainless steel cell comprised of cylindrical cell housing and transparent top quartz window was designed for the in-situ Raman test in this work. For the in-situ Raman measurement, the aluminum foil current collector in the cathode was replaced by one piece of carbon paper with the same sulfur mass loading. To investigate the composition changes of the separator during cycling, there were a spring, a stainless steel spacer with a hole, the lithium foil with a hole, the Celgard separator, and the as-prepared sulfur cathode with another spacer connecting with a spring from the top to the bottom in the housing part. For the measurement of chemical interactions formed between ZnO and LiPSs, the as-prepared sulfur cathode was transferred up to the separator facing the laser directly, and the lithium anode was put under the separator. Two polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) O-rings were added to avoid electrolyte leakage and internal shirt circuit, while four hex bolts were used to seal the whole cell. The testing cell was firstly built up in the argon-filled glove box, rest for 2 h, and then transformed under the XploRA PLUS Raman Microscope utilizing the laser source with a wavelength of 532 nm for test. Meantime, this testing cell was connected to the Neware, CT-3008 W for cycling test by two stainless steel tabs on the cathode and anode sides (as shown in Fig. S1).", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "YS-ZnO", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal-annealing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "ZnCl2", "amount": "calculated amount"}, "prc2": {"name": "C6H12O6", "amount": "calculated amount"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "60 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent": "HCl and NH3·H2O", "ph": "6.0"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "170 °C", "time": "18 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "20 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "200 °C", "time": "3.5 h", "atmosphere": "argon"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "600 °C", "time": "6 h", "atmosphere": "air"}}}}}}}

Ltd. NaOH was provided by Shanghai Maklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. Ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH, Analytical grade) was purchased from Guanghua (Guangzhou) Sci-Tech Co. Ltd. Deionized water was purchased from Congyuan (Guangzhou) Co. Ltd. Polyurethane sponge as substrate with weighing approximately 40 mg was purchased from Zhengzhou Fengtai Nano Material Co., Ltd. It was cut into 3 cm × 1.5 cm × 1 cm cuboid during the experiment. All raw materials were used directly. 2.2 Synthesis of MIL-160 monolith adsorbent based on polyurethane sponge 2.2.1 Dry-gel conversion synthesis of MIL-160 powder The diagram of dry-gel conversion synthesis (DGC) of MIL-160 powder was shown in Fig. 2 . Solution 1 was prepared by adding 2.41 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O to 10 mL of deionized water. Solution 2 was prepared by dissolving 1.561 g of FDCA to different concentrations of NaOH solutions (0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1,0.12 g/mL, respectively). Then add solution 1 dropwise to solution 2. After the two solutions were completely mixed, continue stirring at room temperature for 30 min to form a concentration Al-FDCA gel with a molar ratio of Al3+: FDCA: NaOH = 1:1:1/1.5/2/2.5/3. The gel was placed in a freeze-drying oven and evaporated to powder form to obtain white Al-FDCA dry-gel. Afterward, transfer the dry-gel to a constant temperature and humidity chamber for steam curing, with curing conditions of RH = 85–95 % at room temperature. Finally, the cured dry-gel into was placed in an ordinary sealed glass bottle for crystallization at (50–80 °C) for 24 h. 2.2.2 Dry-gel conversion synthesis of sponge-based MIL-160 monolith adsorbent The preparation of MIL-160 monolith adsorbent was based on the optimal reaction conditions obtained in the powder. The polyurethane sponge substrate was completely immerse in the high concentration Al-FDCA gel with the molar ratio of Al3+:FDCA:NaOH = 1:1:2 for 2 min (show in Fig. 3 ). Then, dry it at freeze-drying oven. Finally, the polyurethane sponge containing Al-FDCA dry gel was directly placed in a constant temperature and humidity chamber crystallization at 60 °C and 95 % RH for 24 h. One of the important characteristics of polyurethane sponge is soft and elastic, therefore in the process of long-term use is not easy to damage. Besides, polyurethane sponge is a non-toxic, tasteless, harmless new environmental protection material. 2.2.3 Purification of MIL-160 powder and monolith adsorbent After the reaction completed, the powder product was cooled to room temperature, and was filtered and sequentially washed three times with hot water and hot ethanol at 60 °C for 3 h to remove unreacted FDCA and other impurities. The monolith adsorbent was rinse alternately with water and ethanol at room temperature three times. Both the powder and monolith are dried at 80 °C for 12 h. It was calculated that about 360 mg monolith adsorbent can be prepared from 50 mg polyurethane sponge substrate. The loading capacity of MIL-160 in the monolith was about 86 wt%. The loading capacity of MIL-160 crystals in monolith adsorbents can be calculated using the following equation: CL= (Wm -Wf) /Wm × 100% where W m was the weight of one piece of the dried monolithic adsorbent and W f was the weight of one piece of the polyurethane sponge. Weighing was performed by an electronic balance (Satorious BSA223S-CW, Beijing Satorious Co. Ltd.). Each set of data was the average of 10 monolith samples obtained at the same gel composition. 2.3 Characterization of the MIL-160 powder and monolith adsorbent XRD patterns of the samples were determined by D8 Advance automatic X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 advance, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the samples were conducted on an ASAP 2460 (Micromeritics instruments Co. USA) at −196 °C. Before the measurement, the samples were outgassed at 150 °C for 12 h. The BET surface area was obtained in the relative pressure range (p/p 0 ) from 0.05 to 0.1. The total pore volume was calculated at p/p 0 of 0.95. Pore size distribution curves were calculated from the N2 sorption isotherms based on density functional theory (DFT) [27]. The surface morphology of the samples was investigated by SU8010 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan) with Pt-target and accelerating voltage of 5 kV. 2.4 Measurement of vapor adsorption/desorption performance of the sample Gravimetric Water Sorption Analyzer (AQUADYNE DVS, Quantachrome Instruments, USA) was used to measure the water vapor adsorption isotherms of the monolith and powder. Its accuracy of the microbalances can be reach ±0.0001 mg. The adsorption kinetics of the MIL-160 monolithic adsorbent were studied in a YH-150L constant temperature and humidity chamber (Dongguan Yi Heng instrument technology Co. Ltd., China). The experiment was designed under relative humidity (RH) of 20 %, 30 % and 60 % at 25 °C, respectively. The weight change of the sample at time intervals of 60 s was recorded by a Sartorius BSA223S-CW electronic balance (Beijing Sartorius Co. Ltd., China) until the saturation of adsorption. The saturated adsorption ratio is denoted as Rs, and the adsorption ratio (Rt) at time t was obtained from the following formula: R t = (m – m 2)/m 2 where m and m2 refer to the weights of the monolith adsorbent before and after adsorption at time t. TG209F3 thermogravimetric analyzer (TG, Netzsch Co., Ltd., Germany) was used to determine desorption activation energy and water releases kinetic curves of the monolith and powder. The programmed desorption was carried out in the range of 30–150 °C at constant heating rate of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 K min−1, respectively. Before the measurement, the sample was first heated to 150 °C to remove impurities, and then it was cooled down to 25 °C and adsorbed water vapor to saturation at P/P0 = 0.6. The desorption activation energy was calculated according to Kissinger equation [28]. In addition, after adsorption saturation, the water releases kinetic curves of samples at 40 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C were further determined using the thermogravimetric analyzer with heating rate of 5 °C/min, the monolith sample quality was about 5 mg. To test the cycle stabilities of the monolith, they were exposed in a chamber at 25 °C, RH 60 % for 30 min and then desorption occurred under 150 °C vacuum for 30 min.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "MIL-160", "Syns_method": "dry-gel conversion synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Al(NO3)3·9H2O", "amount": "2.41 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "FDCA", "amount": "1.561 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "10 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "freeze-dry"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "steam_cure", "parameters": {"temperature": "room temperature", "humidity": "85-95% RH", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "crystallize", "parameters": {"temperature": "50-80 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"solvent": "hot water and ethanol", "temperature": "60 °C", "time": "3 h"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "MIL-160 monolith adsorbent", "Syns_method": "dry-gel conversion synthesis on polyurethane sponge", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Al(NO3)3·9H2O", "amount": "2.41 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "FDCA", "amount": "1.561 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "10 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "immerse", "parameters": {"substrate": "polyurethane sponge", "time": "2 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "freeze-dry"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "steam_cure", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "humidity": "95% RH", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"solvent": "water and ethanol", "time": "3 times"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental Ti₃SiC₂–TiC composites were fabricated using three different powder precursors: 3Ti/Si/2C, 3Ti/SiC/C, and Ti/2TiC/Si. Ti, Si, and C powder precursors, along with SiC and TiC, were mixed in molar ratios and processed in a Pulverisette 6 Planetary Ball Mill for 6 h in toluene inside a WC jar. Elemental powder of commercially available Ti, Si and C (Titanium powder, spherical, −150 mesh, Purity-99.9 %, Alpha-Acer, Silicon powder, crystalline, −325 mesh, 99.5 % (metals basis), Thermo Scientific Chemicals, Graphite powder, 98 % pure, −60 mesh, Loba Chemmie) were used whereas CUMI, m-15 grade SiC powder and TiC (Alfa Acer) were used as the carbide starting materials. Phase transformation behavior and reactive synthesis temperature regime of the as-milled powder were evaluated in a simultaneous thermal analyser (STA) 409C equipment (NETZSCH, Germany) under continuously flowing Ar environment at a rate of 80 mL/min and heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 1550 °C. The as-milled powders were sintered in a Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) [HP D 25, FCT System GmbH, Germany] furnace at 1200–1600 °C at 100 °C intervals, using a graphite mold coated with BN for easy release. The furnace operated at a heating rate of 50 °C/min with a 5-minute soaking at 30 MPa pressure in an Ar environment. Temperature was monitored using an optical pyrometer. Phase identification of SPSed samples was performed using a powder x-ray diffractometer (Rikagu, Japan) in θ−2θ mode, following Bragg-Brentano geometry and using CuKα radiation. Quantitative estimation of the volume fraction of different phases present in the SPSed sampled was carried out by Rietveld refinement using the FullProf software package. The density of the samples was measured using Archimedes Principle, following ASTM-C373 standard. Relative density was calculated by dividing the measured by the theoretical density. Theoretical density of the composite sample was calculated by considering the number of phases present in the sample and their respective volume fractions, obtained from the XRD data. Microstructural observations (grain size, distribution of different phases and morphology) and chemical analysis of the SPSed samples were performed using a Nova Nano 450 (FEI) Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). Finer microstructural details, matrix-precipitate orientation relationships, local compositions of the nano precipitates were characterized in a FEI Tecnai G2 30ST (FEI) transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an EDS detector.

From theoretical calculations, it was observed that addition of P modulates the electron density at Co sites, thereby optimizing the H-adsorption capability, leading to higher HER rate. During anodic polarization, Co-P-B-5 shows formation of large number of CoOOH species on its surface, facilitating OER. Finally, stability, recyclability and wide-pH suitability of Co-P-B-5 was established to demonstrate its industrial viability.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Co-P-B-5", "application": "electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M NaOH", "props": {"overpotential HER": "145 mV @ 10 mA cm-2", "overpotential OER": "290 mV @ 10 mA cm-2"}}}}

However, their practical application is mainly hindered by the polysulfide shuttle and the slow redox kinetic in the electrochemical process. In this study, we prepared FeWO4 nanorods by a simple hydrothermal method to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. The FeWO4 nanorods act as catchers and electrocatalyst for polysulfide in lithium sulfur batteries. These FeWO4 nanorods could efficiently adsorb polysulfide and enhance the conduction of Li ions, leading to inhibition of the polysulfide shuttle effect and enhancement of the electrochemical reaction kinetic for cycling stability and rate performance. Density functional theory calculation shows the existence of the high binding energy between FeWO4 nanorods and polysulfide, which can limit polysulfide to the surface of FeWO4 nanorods. Therefore, the Li-S batteries with FeWO4 nanorods not only provide an initial discharge capacity of 1318 mAh g−1 at the current of 0.8 mA with high coulombic efficiency of 97%, but also shows a capacity decay rate of 0.07% during 600 cycles at a current of 3.2 mA.

The used instruments in this study are listed in Text S1. 2.2 Fabrication of SU101 and SU101 fiber 2.2.1 Syntheses of SU101 The synthesis of SU101 was slightly modified in accordance with the literature [32]. In detail, 0.0787 g of ellagic acid and 0.1937 g of bismuth acetate together dissolved in a 15 mL aqueous acetic acid (6 % by volume), and kept stirring for two days at room temperature. After being purified three times with deionized water and ethanol in sequence, the synthesized SU101 was dried under vacuum. 2.2.2 Preparation of SU101 fibers The neutral silicone sealant (0.75 g) was ultrasonically mixed with cyclohexane (4.5 mL) for 20 min to obtain a homogeneous adhesive solution. The front end of purified stainless steel wires (SSWs, diameter of 470 µm) were immersed in the adhesive solution, and immediately made full contact with the pre-ground uniform powder of SU101. Then, the SU101 SPME fibers were treated in an oven (80 °C, 20 min) to remove cyclohexane. The preparation procedures were repeated some times to obtain final SPME fibers with desired thicknesses. Before the usage, the SU101 fiber was scraped to maintain the coating length at 1 cm by a knife, and soaked in MeOH for 1 h. 2.3 SPME procedures The overall SPME procedure was presented in Fig. S1 as an example. At the selected extraction time and vibration rate, the SPME fiber was directly immersed in a 10 mL glass vial containing 10 mL working solution to extract target analytes. Then, the analytes were desorbed by immersing the fiber in an insertion tube containing 100 μL desorption solvent and oscillating at a specified rate for some time. After desorption duration, the SPME fiber was taken out and immersed in MeOH for approximately 10 min, and dried with clean tissues for reuse.

N, N-dimethylformamide (C3H7NO, DMF), methanol (MeOH), methyl blue (MB), tert-butanol (TBA), and other chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Ltd. 2.2 Preparation of ZIF-67@Ce-MOF Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (0.5 mmol) and homophthalic acid (0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of DMF and stirred for 30 min respectively, then the two solutions were mixed and stirred for another 30 min. The mixed solution was added into a tetrafluoroethylene lined hydrothermal kettle and heated at 90 °C for 48 h. At the end of the reaction, a white solid was formed. It was washed three times with DMF and methanol in turn. Then it was dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h to obtain a white powder, named as Ce-MOF (Yassin et al., 2021). 100 mg of Ce-MOF was then dispersed in 20 mL of ethanolic solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide at a concentration of 10 g/L and stirred for 12 h (Guan and David Lou, 2017). Cetyl trimethylammonium bromideas surfactant (CTAB) was used as a sacrificial template. The sample was then washed three times with anhydrous ethanol and dispersed in 10 mL of methanol and the suspension was then poured into 150 mL of methanolic solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate at a concentration of 20 mmol/L, followed by adding 250 mL of an ethanolic solution of 2-methylimidazole at a concentration of 80 mmol/L and left for 24 h. After filtration, the sample was washed three times with methanol and water in turn to obtain a purple powder, which was named as ZIF-67@Ce-MOF. 2.3 Preparation of ZIF-67@Ce-MOF-600 Afterwards, ZIF-67@Ce-MOF was placed in a tube furnace for heat treatment at a heating rate of 2 °C/min and the sample was held at 600 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. A final black soild powder named as ZIF-67@Ce-MOF-600 was obtained. This step is designed to transform the MOF material into a derivative (Wang et al., 2018) and thus increase its stability Fig. 1 a shows the synthesis specific steps. 2.4 Characterization The morphology of ZIF-67@Ce-MOF-600 was confirmed by SEM (ZEISS sigma 300) and the elemental composition was analyzed by Oxford energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) equipped in the SEM instrument. In addition, the detailed structure of the precursor was obtained by TEM (FEI G2 F30 300 KV). Next, the structure was further confirmed by XRD (Rigaku 2500 V) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, SHIMADZU IR Tracer-100), and the magnetic properties of the material were determined by hysteresis lines. Furthermore, ultraviolet–visible near infrared spectroscopy (UV–vis-IR, SHIMADZU UV-3600Plus), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI+), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR, Bruker A300), high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC Thermo Q-EXACTIVE) and DFT calculations as the main analytical tools were used to analyze the catalytic properties and mechanisms. 2.5 Catalytic performance study The activation performance of the catalyst for PMS was determined by testing the removal rate of TC. 20 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of TC solution (20 mg TC/L). After stirring for 30 min to reach adsorption-desorption equilibrium, PMS was added to active the degradation reaction of TC. Samples were designed every 5 min intervals, 5 mL of the solution was removed by pipetting and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter to filters out the solid catalyst residue, followed by the addition of aqueous Na2S2O3 (3 g/L) for rapid bursting of the residual radicals in the solution. The reasons for choosing Na2S2O3 but not methanol are as follows: (1) Na2S2O3 can react with HSO5 − to terminate the reaction (S2O3 2− + HSO5 − → SO4 2− + H2O), whereas methanol terminates the reaction by quenching the free radicals; (2) methanol can quench SO4 − and –OH, but unable to remove 1O2, which often leads to serious experimental errors because of the existing of both free radical and non-free radical processes. The concentration of TC was then measured at 357 nm using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer and the removal rate of TC was calculated by Eq. (1). The pseudo first-order kinetics shown in Eq. (2) was used to analyze the digital, where k denotes the rate constant of the removal reaction and C0 and Ct denote the initial and residual concentrations of TC (Li et al., 2022b; Zhu et al., 2022).

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Theory and modeling methods 2.1 Design principle and materials selection To realize structural coloration of daytime radiative cooling, we demonstrate a colorful radiative cooling coating, as shown in Fig. 1 . Low-cost PMMA resin is taken as the matrix due to its high MIR emissivity enabling high-performance daytime radiative cooling (Wang et al., 2021). Meanwhile, we choose randomly dispersed submicron dielectric particles as sunlight scatterers, and metallic nanoparticles for structural coloration producing narrow reflection dips. To achieve high reflection within solar spectrum, we adopt submicron Y2O3 particles with a high refractive index of 2.07 ∼ 1.86 in this region and a high electron band gap of ∼5.6 eV avoiding the UV absorption. The volume fraction of Y2O3 particles is kept at a moderate value of f Y 2 O 3 = 30 % avoiding reduction of emissivity due to the impedance mismatch. For structural coloration, we produce narrow absorption peaks in visible region by LSPR of metallic nanoparticles, including noble metal nanoparticles or dielectric-noble metal core–shell nanoparticles. In this work, two common types of metallic nanoparticles including plain Ag and TiO2@Ag are chosen for structural coloration, as shown in Fig. 1. The particle volume fractions of these nanoparticles are kept at small values ( f MNP ~ 10 - 4 % ). Due to the narrow absorption peaks caused by the LSPR of metallic nanoparticles and strong scattering of sunlight by submicron Y2O3 particles, at least one narrow-reflectance dip will appear in the visible spectrum for structural coloration. Meanwhile, the PMMA matrix exhibits high MIR emissivity for subambient daytime radiative cooling. 2.2 Spectral reflectivity and emissivity of colorful coatings In the wavelength range of 0.3–2.5 μm, due to the presence of Y2O3 nanoparticles with high scattering cross section and high absorption cross section of metallic nanoparticles at LSPR, light propagates in the coating with complicated scattering and absorption processes. In this sense, the spectral reflectivity and absorptivity can be calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation (RTE) (Modest, 2013): (1) d I λ ds = κ λ I b λ - ( κ λ + σ s λ ) I λ + σ s λ 4 π ∫ 4 π I λ ( Ω i ) Φ ( Ω i , Ω ) d Ω i , where I λ is the spectral radiative intensity, I b λ is the spectral intensity of blackbody, s is the transport path length, κ λ is the absorption coefficient of coating, which is mainly determined by the absorption cross section of metallic nanoparticles in the visible region. σ s λ is the scattering coefficient, which is mainly determined by the scattering of Y2O3 submicron particles. Moreover, since the volume fraction of Y2O3 particles exceeds 5%, dependent scattering effect between these particles should be taken into account (Wang and Zhao, 2020; Wang and Zhao, 2015; Wang and Zhao, 2018a; Wang and Zhao, 2018b). Φ Ω i , Ω is the phase function representing the scattering probability from direction Ω i to direction Ω . Both Y2O3 submicron particles (Sordelet et al., 1988) and metallic nanoparticles (Bastús et al., 2014; Xuan et al., 2014) can be fabricated and treated as spherical. As a result, their radiative properties, including scattering efficiency Q s c a , extinction efficiency Q e x t , and asymmetry parameter g , can be derived by Mie theory. Moreover, During the calculation of light scattering and absorbing processes inside the composite coatings, we propose some simplifications including: (1) The volume fraction of nanoparticles for structural coloration ( f M N P ~ 10 - 4 % ) can be considered negligible compared to the Y2O3 particles ( f Y 2 O 3 = 30 % ). We can simply assume that there is no dependent scattering effect between these two types of particles. Based on this assumption, we calculate the radiative properties of a single Y2O3 submicron particle and metallic nanoparticle under dependent scattering and independent scattering, respectively. (2) We consider the effect of Y2O3 particles on refractive index by calculating the effective complex refractive index m e f f = ξ e f f of this particles-embedded coating derived by the Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory (MG-EMT) as (Wang and Zhao, 2020; Liew et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2017). (2) ξ eff - ξ h ξ eff + 2 ξ h = Σ f i ξ i - ξ h ξ i + 2 ξ h , where ε i and f i are the dielectric function and volume fraction of Y2O3 particles, the core, and shell of all types of nanoparticles inside the coating which can be calculated as f c o r e = ∑ j = 1 k f j r j , c o r e 3 r j , t o t a l 3 and f s h e l l = ∑ j = 1 k f j 1 - r j , c o r e 3 r j , t o t a l 3 . ξ h is the dielectric function of PMMA matrix. m e f f will be used during the radiative properties’ calculation of nanoparticles and spectral emissivity calculation of coatings. (3) The imaginary part of effective refractive index of coating is vanishingly small in the wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm so that it has little effect on the radiative properties of single particles. As a result, we assume that n e f f = R e m e f f during the calculation of Scattering efficiency and extinction efficiency. In the calculation, the refractive index of matrix medium PMMA is taken from Zhang et al. (2020b,c), the refractive index in the range of 0.3–24 μm of Y2O3, TiO2, and silver are taken from Ref. (Palik, 1998) and Ref. (Yang et al., 2015), respectively, which are all presented in the Fig. 2 . Moreover, for the plain Ag nanoparticle and Ag shell of TiO2@Ag nanoparticle, the refractive index should be corrected to account for the electron scattering due to collisions at the boundaries. The detail of correction is shown in Appendix A. For metallic nanoparticles, under the independent scattering approximation (ISA), these parameters of metallic nanoparticles can be directly calculated from the Mie scattering coefficients a n and b n . For plain spherical nanoparticles (plain Ag nanoparticles), the Mie scattering coefficients are. (3) a n = m ∼ ψ n m ∼ x ψ n ′ x - ψ n x ψ n ′ m ∼ x m ∼ ψ n m ∼ x ξ n ′ x - ξ n x ψ n ′ m ∼ x , (4) b n = ψ n m ∼ x ψ n ′ x - m ∼ ψ n x ψ n ′ m ∼ x ψ n m ∼ x ξ n ′ x - m ∼ ξ n x ψ n ′ m ∼ x , where size parameter x = 2 π n e f f r A g λ , relative refractive index m ∼ = m p n e f f ( m p = n p + i k p is the complex refractive index of nanoparticles embedded). Moreover, for core–shell particles, the coated sphere has an inner radius r c o r e with size parameter x i = 2 π n e f f r c o r e λ and a coating of outer radius r t o t a l with size parameter y o = 2 π n e f f r t o t a l λ . The relative refractive index of inner and coating materials of core–shell nanoparticles are m ∼ 1 = m c o r e / n e f f and m ∼ 2 = m s h e l l / n e f f , where m c o r e = n c o r e + i k c o r e and m s h e l l = n s h e l l + i k s h e l l . The Mie scattering coefficients a n and b n can be calculated as: (5) a n = D ∼ n / m ∼ 2 + n / y o ψ n y o - ψ n - 1 y o D ∼ n / m ∼ 2 + n / y o ξ n y o - ξ n - 1 y o , (6) b n = m ~ 2 G ~ n + n / y o ψ n y o - ψ n - 1 y o m ~ 2 G ~ n + n / y o ξ n y o - ξ n - 1 y o , where. (7) D ∼ n = D n m ∼ 2 y o - A n χ n ′ m ∼ 2 y o / ψ n m ∼ 2 y o 1 - A n χ n m ∼ 2 y o / ψ n m ∼ 2 y o , (8) G ∼ n = D n m ∼ 2 y o - B n χ n ′ m ∼ 2 y o / ψ n m ∼ 2 y o 1 - B n χ n m ∼ 2 y o / ψ n m ∼ 2 y o , and A n , B n are. (9) A n = ψ n m ∼ 2 x i m ∼ ′ D n m ∼ 1 x i - D n m ∼ 2 x i m ∼ ′ D n m ∼ 1 x i χ n m ∼ 2 x i - χ n ′ m ∼ 2 x i , (10) B n = ψ n m ~ 2 x i D n m ~ 1 x i / m ~ ' - D n m ~ 2 x i D n m ~ 1 x i χ n m ~ 2 x i / m ~ ' - χ n ' m ~ 2 x i . In Eqs. (3)–(10), ψ n z , χ n z , ξ n z , D n z are special functions that can be expressed as. (11) ψ n z = z j n z ; χ n z = - z y n z ; ξ n z = z h n 1 z ; D n z = ψ n ′ z / ψ n z where j n z , y n z and h n 1 z are the first and second kinds of spherical Bessel functions, and the first kind of spherical Hankel function in the order of n , respectively. ψ n ′ z and χ n ′ z are the first-order derivative respecting to argument z . The parameter m ∼ ′ is m ∼ ′ = m ∼ 2 m ∼ 1 . Once the Mie scattering coefficients of particles are derived, we can calculate the scattering efficiency Q s c a , extinction efficiency Q e x t , absorption efficiency Q a b s as (Bohren and Huffman, 2008). (12) Q s c a = 2 x 2 ∑ n = 1 ∞ 2 n + 1 a n 2 + b n 2 , (13) Q e x t = 2 x 2 ∑ n = 1 ∞ 2 n + 1 a n + b n , (14) Q a b s = Q e x t - Q s c a . here, the r of size parameter x is the radius of plain spherical particles, or outer radius of core–shell particles, respectively. For Y2O3 particles, to consider the dependent scattering effect, we use the interference approximation (ITA), which can be regarded as the first-order correction to the DSE by taking the “collective scattering” due to structural correlations into account. Under the interference approximation (Wang and Zhao, 2020 ;), we can utilize a structure factor S q = 2 k m s i n θ s 2 to modify the results of Mie theory then derive the radiative properties, k m = 2 π n e f f λ is the wavenumber in surrounding medium with effective refractive index. The modified differential scattering cross section can be given as: (15) d C s , I T A d θ s = S q d C s , M i e d θ s . We can get the scattering cross sections by directly integrating Eq. (15) over θ s as. (16) C s , I T A = ∫ 0 π S q d C s , M i e d θ s s i n θ s d θ s , d C s , M i e / d θ s can be derived from Mie theory as: (17) d C s , M i e d θ s = π k 2 S 1 θ s 2 + S 2 θ s 2 , (18) S 1 θ s = ∑ n = 1 ∞ 2 n + 1 n n + 1 a n π n c o s θ s + b n τ n c o s θ s , (19) S 2 θ s = ∑ n = 1 ∞ 2 n + 1 n n + 1 a n τ n c o s θ s + b n π n c o s θ s . In Eqs. (15)–(19), θ s is the polar scattering angle with respect to the incident wavevector, π n c o s θ = - d P n 1 c o s θ d θ and τ n c o s θ = - d P n 1 c o s θ s i n θ are special functions. The structure factor S q can be calculated from the pair distribution function (PDF) g 2 r as (Wang and Zhao, 2020;): (20) S q = 1 + n 0 ∫ g 2 r - 1 e x p - i q ∙ r d r . Here, we use the PDF based on Percus-Yevick (P-Y) approximation (Baxter, 1968). After the correction, the scattering efficiency Q s c a under ITA can be derived as Q s c a = C s , I T A / π r 2 , while the absorption efficiency Q a b s can still be calculated by Eq. (14) from Mie theory. Meanwhile, for all types of particles shown above, the scattering asymmetry factor of a single particle can be calculated via the scattering cross sections as: (21) g = 1 C s , I T A ∫ 0 π d C s , I T A d θ s c o s θ s s i n θ s d θ s . In this work, the nanoparticle embedded coating is assumed as a statistically homogeneous medium with scattering coefficient σ s λ and absorption coefficient κ λ . Since the submicron Y2O3 particles and metallic nanoparticles mainly determine the radiative properties of cooling coatings in this range of wavelengths, we can obtain the scattering coefficient σ s λ and the absorption coefficient κ λ as: (22) σ s λ = ∑ i 3 f i 4 r i Q sca , i , (23) κ λ = ∑ i 3 f i 4 r i Q abs , i + 4 π · I m ( m PMMA ) λ . After derivation of radiative properties of the coating, we use Monte Carlo (MC) method to calculate the spectral reflectivity and absorptivity within the wavelength range of 0.3 μm to 2.5 μm by solving the Eqs. (1). In the wavelength range of 2.5 μm to 24 μm, with the increment of the imaginary part of PMMA resin, the calculation based on Mie theory just considering the real part of matrix medium cannot precisely predict the optical property of particles-embedded coating. Since the sizes of particles inside are much smaller than the incident wavelengths in this range, the coating can be simply treated as an isotropic layer with thickness d and effective complex refractive index of m e f f calculated by Eq. (2), between two ambient layers ( n = 1 ), whose spectral reflectivity and absorptivity can be calculated by the standard thin film models (Spanier et al., 2000). 2.3 Daytime radiative cooling performance To quantify the radiative cooling performance of radiative coolers, we calculate the cooling power at different temperature T . According to energy balance theory, the net radiative cooling power can be calculated with the following equation (Raman et al., 2014): (24) P c o o l T = P r a d T - P s u n - P a t m T a m b - P n o n - r a d , where T a m b is the ambient temperature. In Eq. ( 24 ), the radiative power emitted by per area of coating ( P r a d T ), the absorbed power of coating due to incident atmospheric thermal radiation ( P a t m T a m b ), the absorbed power of coating due to incident solar radiation ( P s u n ), and the non-radiative absorbed power ( P n o n - r a d ) due to convection and conduction can be calculated by: (25) P r a d T = ∫ 0 ∞ ∫ 0 2 π ∫ 0 π 2 ε λ , θ I b b T , λ s i n θ c o s θ d θ d φ d λ , (26) P a t m T a m b = ∫ 0 ∞ ∫ 0 2 π ∫ 0 π 2 ε a t m λ , θ ε λ , θ I b b T a m b , λ s i n θ c o s θ d θ d φ d λ , (27) P s u n = ∫ 0 ∞ ε λ , θ S u n ∙ I A M 1.5 λ d λ , (28) P n o n - r a d = h c T a m b - T , where I b b T , λ is the spectral blackbody intensity, ε λ , θ is the spectral directional emissivity, ε a t m λ , θ = 1 - t λ , 0 1 / c o s θ (Granqvist and Hjortsberg, 1981) is the spectral directional emissivity of the atmosphere. In the calculation model, the column water vapor is assumed to be 1.6 mm and the air mass is 1.5. The atmospheric transmittance in the zenith direction t λ , 0 is obtained from Ref. (Atmospheric Transmission Data, 2005). I A M 1.5 λ is the solar radiance with direct normal irradiance of 900 W/m2 (Standard Tables for Reference Solar Spectral Irradiances, 2012). We assumed that our colorful coatings are facing the sun, so the absorptivity is equal to the emissivity in normal direction according to Kirchhoff’s law. For the calculation of non-radiative heat transfer, we initially assume that h c = 6.9 W / m 2 ∙ K according to Ref. (Raman et al., 2014), which is widely used in the calculation models in pervious works. Then, to demonstrate the influence of wind speed on radiative cooling, we use the empirical equations in Ref. (Zhao et al., 2019) to calculate the non-radiative heat transfer coefficient by wind speed. To quantify the radiative cooling performance of coatings shown above, two parameters can be used to quantify the performance (Bao et al., 2017). One is the lowest temperature the coating can achieve when the net radiative cooling power is zero ( P n e t = 0 ). The other is the net radiative cooling power when the temperature of coating is the same as ambient temperature ( T = T a m b ).", "output": {}}

Ltd., South Korea). The powder was thermally calcined in a furnace at 600 °C for 5 h to remove any organic matter. The powder was then sieved to investigate the contents of the leached strategic metals according to the particle size. Different sizes of the powders were digested in aqua regia as a control leachate at 80 °C for 1 d. After reviewing the results, a particle size of 106–150 µm (16.1 wt% Ni, 4.1 wt% Li, 8.0 wt% Mn, and 9.1 wt% Co) was selected for further leaching experiments (Table S1). For green leaching, various organic acids, such as acetic acid, ascorbic acid, citric acid, glutaric acid, and tartaric acid (CAS No. 64–19–7, 50–81–7, 77–92–9, 107–93–7, and 526–83–0, respectively) and reductants, such as hydrogen peroxide, ascorbic acid, glycine, and glucose (CAS No. 7722–84–1, 50–81–7, 56–40–6, and 50–99–7, respectively), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Korea Ltd. Both the organic acids and reductants studied are less toxic than sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The chemical properties and LD50 values of these compounds are listed in Table 1. 2.2 Leaching for the recovery of strategic metals from NMC batteries Leaching experiments were conducted to evaluate the leaching efficiencies of Ni, Li, Mn, and Co via various organic acids and reductants. The powdered spent NMC batteries were added to a 2 M solution of the organic acid in a glass vial equipped with a cap (pulp density=50 g/L), and the samples were shaken for 3 h in a shaking water bath maintained at 80 °C and 200 rpm. For the reduction of Mn4+ and Co3+, 5 wt% H2O2 was added to the leachants. The leaching efficiency of the strategic metals was calculated using Eq. 1. (1) E SM = W Sm in organic acdis W Sm in aqua regia × 100 % where E sm (%) is the leaching efficiency of the strategic metals (sm = Ni, Li, Mn, or Co) and W sm (g) is the leached weight of the strategic metal obtained using the different leachants studied. Microwave-assisted leaching was conducted to improve the performance in terms of both the leaching rate and efficiency. The samples were placed in a closed-vessel microwave reactor (MDS-6G, SINEO, China) at 150 °C and 800 W. The temperature of the microwave-irradiated sample was measured using a temperature sensor in the reactor and monitored on the screen. The leaching experiments were performed in triplicate, and the average values were reported along with their corresponding standard deviations. 2.3 Recovery of NiMnCoC2O4 from the leachate After the green leaching process, the leachate was filtered using a bottle top filter with a 0.2 µm pore size (Nalgene™ Rapid-Flow™) to remove the solid residue. A certain concentration of oxalic acid was added as a precipitant to the leachate to separate the divalent metal ions [Ni(II), Mn(II), and Co(II)] from the monovalent metal ion [Li(I)]. The compound generated upon the reaction between the metal ions and oxalic acid precipitated and was located at the bottom of the mixture. After the precipitated sample was completely recovered from the leachate, it was washed with distilled water several times and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 1 d. 2.4 Pseudocapacitor preparation The working electrode was fabricated using NiMnCoC2O4 obtained during separation. A slurry was prepared by mixing (8:1:1 wt ratio NiMnCoC2O4 as the active material, Super-P as the conductive agent, and polyvinylidene fluoride as the binder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone). The slurry was then coated on a Ni foam substrate as a current collector (active area=1 ×1 cm2) and dried in a vacuum oven at 90 °C for 1 d. The slurry-coated Ni foam, Pt wire, and Hg/HgO electrodes were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. All electrochemical measurements were conducted in a 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The specific capacitance was determined using Eq. 2 (Sun et al., 2019). (2) C = I/[(⊿V/⊿t)m] where C (F/g) is the specific capacitance, I (A) is the current applied, ⊿V/⊿t is the slope of the discharge curve after the IR drop at the beginning of the discharge curve, and m (g) is the mass of the electrode. 2.5 Analytical methods Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) installed in the Future Energy Convergence Core Center at Jeonbuk National University was conducted on an iCAP 7000 series instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) to measure the concentration of the strategic metals in the leachant during the leaching and separation steps. All samples were diluted with 2% nitric acid and measured within a reliable standard curve range. The precipitated samples were analyzed by FE-SEM, EDAX, EDS mapping, and XRD at the Center for University-side Research Facilities located at Jeonbuk National University. For FE-SEM with EDAX and EDS mapping, the samples were coated with Pt using a vacuum coater to avoid charging effects. Further analysis was performed via XPS installed at the Jeonju Center of the Korea Basic Science Institute. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) were measured using a SP-200 potentiostat (Bio-Logic, USA) over the potential window of 0.0–0.4 V (vs. Hg/HgO).", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "NiMnCoC2O4", "Syns_method": "precipitation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {}, "solvents": {}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental section\nChemicals and instrumentations\nFor synthesis of polymer monoliths, chemicals like ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA, ≥98%), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), and 2-vinyl pyridine (2-VP, ≥ 95%), are purchased from TCI chemicals. For mesoporous silica monolith synthesis, chemicals like tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, ≥ 98%), Pluronic F127, and n-dodecane (≥ 99%) are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The chromoionophoric probes (BDHCA and ATDBD) are synthesized using chemicals like 4-butylaniline (97%), salicylaldehyde (99%), thiosemicarbazide (99%), 2-amino-5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadazole (98%), allyl bromide (99%), and resorcinol (99%) that are from Alfa Aesar chemicals.\nThe low-/wide-angle XRD pattern for monolithic optical sensors are characterized using a p-X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, D8 Advance). The surface and porosity properties of monoliths are calculated using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm (Quantachrome, Autosorb-iQ). The monolith structural and surface morphologies are studied using FE-SEM-EDAX (Hitachi, S-4800), and HR-TEM-SAED (Tecnai, G2 20 S-Twin). The monolith and probe structural features are characterized by a FT-IR spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Nicolet iS10). The structural features of chromoionophoric ligands and monolithic templates are confirmed by 1H/13C NMR and 29Si/13C CPMAS solid-state NMR (Bruker, Avance 400 MHz), CHNS analyzer (Vario, MICRO Select EL), and an HR-ESI-MS (Waters, QToF Xevo G2-XS). The thermal stability of sensor materials is monitored by TGA (Seiko, SII 7200). The sensor elemental oxidation states are studied using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 VersaProb-II). The optical spectra of solid-state sensors are analyzed by using a UV-Vis-DRS (Jasco, V670) instrument. The elemental composition of environmental and synthetic samples is analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, ELAN DRC-e PerkinElmer).\nSynthesis of chromoionophoric probes (BDHCA and ATDBD)\nFor the synthesis of BDHCA probe molecules, 10 mmol of 4-butylaniline is diazotized, in the presence of NaNO2 and 6 M HCl at 0 °C, and coupled with an equimolar ratio of salicylaldehyde in 10% NaOH solution to afford compound 1(a), as shown in the Supplementary Information (ESM, Section I; Scheme S1a).

HR-ESI-MS: 355.15.\nThe ATDBD probe is synthesized by the allylation of 2-amino-5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadazole with equimolar allyl bromide in the presence of K2CO3, in dry acetone, at room temperature for 24 h. The compound 2a is subjected to diazotization and coupled with resorcinol in 10% NaOH under ice-cold condition, thus resulting in the desired orange-colored product (ATDBD, Yield 92%), as shown in the schematic representation (ESM, Section I; Scheme S1b).

HR-ESI-MS: 294.02.\nFabrication of BDHCA impregnated MSM sensor\nThe 2D-hexagonal array of mesoporous honeycomb-structured MSM is prepared by a triblock copolymer surfactant mediated micro-emulsion technique–based sol-gel process, using F127 and n-dodecane, as a structure-directing entity (SDE) and porogens, respectively [33]. The amphiphilic probe (BDHCA) is directly impregnated to the synthesized MSM template, by physical adsorption, for which a known quantity (mmol) of BDHCA ligand in 500 cm3 of ethanol is continuously homogenized with a 1.0 g of MSM. The probe impregnation on the monolithic template is carried out through the gradual removal of solvent molecules using a rota-evaporator. The probe anchored MSM with a maximum signal response is denoted as Sensor-I. The sensor material is washed with deionized water to ensure the non-leachability of probe molecules and then subjected to vacuum drying for 10 h, at 40 °C. The extent of probe molecule loading onto the monolith material has been studied, which reveals a saturation limit of 0.56 mmol of BDHCA probe loading per gram of MSM, as discussed in the ESM (Section II; Table S1). However, for the effective sensing of Co(II) ions (from sub-ppb to ppb) in terms of naked-eye and spectral analysis, 0.196 mmol of BDHCA probe-coated MSM template provided the best sensing performance, particularly for the reliable monitoring of ultra-trace Co(II) ions.\nFabrication of ATDBD functionalized MPM sensor\nThe ATDBD functionalized MPM sensor is synthesized through one-pot bulk polymerization of ATDBD (0.5–3.0 mmol; monomer), EGDMA (10.0 mmol; cross-linker), and AIBN (1.0 wt.%; radical initiator) that are dissolved in 7.5 cm3 of dry DMSO (porogen). The polymerization is performed in a dry Schlenk tube, and the reactant solution mixture is subjected to ultrasonic degassing, and then purged with N2 gas for 10 min. For completion of the polymerization process, the mixture is stirred at 60 °C for 48 h. The excess monomer and the formed oligomers are removed using hexane. The resulting ATDBD functionalized MPM sensor, henceforth denoted as Sensor-II, is vacuum dried at 40 °C for 10 h. The polymerization reaction pertaining to the formation of Sensor-II has been included in the ESM (Section III; Fig. S1).\nAnalytical operation for Co(II) optical sensing\nTo facilitate solid-state colorimetric detection, a definite concentration of Co(II) solution are prepared in various solution pH conditions, where pH 7–8 provided the best ion-sensing performance. The various concentrations of Co(II) solution is equilibrated in a mechanical shaker with a certain quantity (4~6 mg) of sensor materials, for a specific duration (1–10 min) in a solution temperature (25–40 °C), in an overall volume of 20 cm3. A blank (without a metal ion) is prepared in a similar procedure for color comparison during naked-eye recognition by filtering the sensor material using a membrane filter (Millipore, 25 mm cellulose nitrate). The spectral pattern resulting from charge transfer color transition due to probe-Co(II) complexation is studied using UV-Vis-DRS measurement (RSD < 2.82%, triplicate analysis). The stoichiometric ratio of Co(II)-probe (BDHCA andATDBD) complexation has been studied by Job’s plot (Section IV; Fig. S2), and also confirmed by 1H NMR titration (Section V; Fig. S3), as discussed in the ESM.\nCollection of water samples and scrap Li-ion batteries for Co(II) sensing\nThe groundwater and lake water samples are collected from Industrial Area, Ranipet district, Tamil Nadu, India. A certified pre-treated electronics industry wastewater is obtained from special economic zone (SEZ), Kanchipuram district, Tamil Nadu, India. The obtained samples are spiked with known quantities of Co(II) ions and are subjecting to ICP-MS analysis to authenticate cobalt ion concentration, amidst various matrix constituents. For the sensing/recovery of cobalt ions from scarp Li-ion batteries, the active ingredients (powder) from the anode and cathode materials of Li-ion batteries are obtained from an e-waste recovery unit in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. The sample powder (1 g) is dissolved in 25 mL of aqua regia (HNO3:HCl, 1:3) and the homogenous solution is diluted with 975 mL of deionized water. From the resulting stock solution, 100 μL of aliquot (after dilution to 1000 mL) is pH adjusted and subjected to cobalt ion sensing using the proposed sensors.

Recent scientific evidence suggests that nanotechnology can positively impact the agriculture sector by reducing the harmful effects of farming operations on human health and nature, as well as improving food productivity and security.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "The hybrid structure of high conductive carbon materials with large capacitive metal compounds is one of promising strategies for achieving high specific capacity, cycling stability, and ultrafast Li-ion storage capability due to their synergistic effects. This article will demonstrate the novel hybrid structure of a zinc oxysulfide (ZnOS) lamination layer on a sulfur (S)-doped carbon nanofiber (SCNF) matrix via an electrospinning method with sequential atomic layer deposition (ALD) process and will also present the structural advantages for ultrafast Li-ion batteries (LIBs). As a double-anion material, ZnOS has benefits compared with single ZnO and ZnS during the charge/discharge process, which is accompanied with consecutive conversion and alloying reactions. To verify these factors, structural analysis at the atomic scale and various electrochemical properties were evaluated. The resultant ZnOS/SCNF electrode showed superior electrochemical performance such as high specific capacity (672.8 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1), good capacity retention (87.8% after 100 cycles), and excellent cycling stability (85.4% after 500 cycles). This is attributed to the facilitated kinetic properties including electron and ion transfer efficiency during the electrochemical reactions, accompanied with the ZnOS/SCNF hybrid structure.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experiments and methods 2.1 Experimental materials Ti3AlC2 (MXene) was purchased from 11 Technology Co., Ltd., nano CeO2 (20–50 nm, spherical) was purchased from Shanghai McLean Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd.; Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) solution (PDDA, Average molecular weight 200,000∼350,000, 20wt% in H2O), poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS, average molecular weight ∼70,000), ammonium persulfate, concentrated hydrochloric acid, aniline, ethanol, all purchased from Beijing Aoboxing Biotechnology Co ., Ltd. 2.2 IDE substrate preprocessing A 10 × 10 mm ceramic interdigitated electrode (IDE) was utilized, featuring a metal wire spacing of 50 μm. First, 2 mL of a 20 % PDDA solution was absorbed and subsequently diluted with 38 mL of deionized water to prepare a 1 % PDDA solution. Additionally, 0.1 g of PSS powder was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water to achieve a concentration of 2 mg/mL. A rubber tip dropper was then employed to incrementally add concentrated hydrochloric acid until the pH value of the solution reached 1, as determined by comparison with a standard color chart. The prepared solutions were sonicated for 15 min before use. Secondly, the IDE substrate was immersed in PDDA solution (1 %) for 15 min to allow positive charges to be adsorbed on the surface. Use a rubber dropper to absorb deionized water for drip washing, blow dry with nitrogen, and then immerse it in the polyanionic PSS solution (2 mg/ml, pH ≈ 1) for 15 min to make the surface negatively charged through electrostatic interaction. Finally, it was washed dropwise with deionized water and dried with nitrogen. The processed IDE substrate was placed in a nitrogen environment and stored. Since polyaniline presents a positively charged state during polymerization, the positively charged material is drop-coated on the negatively charged IDE substrate to easily combine with each other to form a film, making the gas-sensitive film strong and reliable. The utensils used during the experiment were cleaned according to the following steps: ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, ethanol, and deionized water for 15 min. After completion, they were placed in a drying oven with a constant temperature of 70 °C for drying. 2.3 Preparation mechanism of PANI/Ti3AlC2/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite thin film sensor In the process of aniline synthesis, HCl, as a proton acid, provides protons for the reaction and guarantees the appropriate acidity of the solution system. Ti3AlC2 and nano-CeO2 were added to the aniline solution in turn, so that the three were mixed evenly. Nano-CeO2 and aniline particles were attached to Ti3AlC2, and then ammonium persulfate was added. Ammonium persulfate mainly acted as an oxidant. Aniline molecules were oxidized by ammonium persulfate. The amino group (-NH2) of aniline and the hydrogen atom (-H) on the benzene ring were oxidized to free radicals to produce active intermediates, and the carbon-nitrogen bond between aniline was continuously formed. The polymer chain is gradually increased, and finally the nano-PANI/Ti3AlC2/CeO2 composite is formed. In addition, the experimental process needs to be carried out in an ice water bath. The polymerization process of aniline is a free radical ion reaction process, which is an exothermic reaction. With the increase of temperature, the delocalization of π electrons on the molecular chain decreases, and the adhesion of nano CeO2 and polyaniline on Ti3AlC2 is affected, which in turn affects the conductivity. 2.4 Preparation of PANI/Ti3AlC2/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite thin film sensor First, add 100 μL of aniline to 20 ml of 2 mol/L HCl solution, and stir rapidly in a magnetic stirring water bath under ice-water bath (0–5 °C) conditions. Next, weigh 0.005 g of Ti3AlC2 and CeO2 of the same mass and dissolve them in 10 mL of water. And ultrasonic for 15 min, then add to the aniline solution and stir quickly. Finally, prepare 10 mL of 0.1 mol/L ammonium persulfate solution and slowly drop it into the mixed solution within 3 min. It can be observed that the solution will gradually change from pink to light blue, and then to dark green. After the solution turns dark green, continue to stir for 24 h. After the reaction is completed, alternately centrifuge and wash with 2mol/L hydrochloric acid solution and deionized water. Three times, use a pipette to draw 10μL of the solution and apply it dropwise on the treated IDE substrate. After drying at room temperature for 24 h, a PANI/Ti3AlC2/CeO2 ternary composite nanocomposite thin film sensor was obtained. Afterwards, part of the solution was taken out and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h, and then ground in a clean agate mortar, and the obtained powder was used for characterization analysis. Pure PANI material thin film sensors, PANI/Ti3AlC2 material thin film sensors, and PANI/CeO2 material thin film sensors were prepared using the same method as above as the control group. 2.5 Experimental characterization The micromorphology of the four synthetic materials was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Apreo S HiVac), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy analysis (TEM, ThermoFisher TalosF200X G2), while the element distribution was qualitatively analyzed. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Nicolet iS10) was used to study The functional groups and chemical bonds of the four synthetic materials, with a wavelength range of 4000∼500cm−1; use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB XI+) to conduct full spectrum and fine spectrum analysis of the four sample powders produced, and analyze the four samples The element content and the chemical state of specific elements; use an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance) to analyze the crystal structure of the material. The incident light source is Cu Kα1 rays (λ=1.54059 nm), and the ray tube voltage is the same as the currents are 40 kV and 20 mA respectively, the scanning speed of the test instrument is 10.0°min−1, and the scanning range is 5–80° The thermal stability of the material was analyzed using a thermogravimetric (TG-DTG, Apreo S HiVac) instrument with a heating rate of 10 °C /min and a temperature range of 30–800 °C; a UV–visible and near-infrared spectrophotometer (UV–Vis, Hitachi UH4150) Analyze the chemical bonds and energy band structure of PANI/Ti3AlC2/CeO2 composite material such as C = C. 2.6 Preparation and measurement of gas sensors The experiment utilized a self-constructed gas testing system developed in the laboratory, as depicted in Fig. 1 (b). This system comprises a constant pressure and current power supply (MS1220DS), a signal collector (ZS-ACI-485), a gas chamber, a gas flow controller (MFC, AITOLY, MFC300), and a gas cylinder, among other components. The dried IDE substrate was positioned in the gas chamber, and the sensing performance of the sensor was evaluated at 24 °C and 30 % relative humidity. To maintain stability within the gas chamber, dry air was introduced as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 500 sccm, ensuring that the resistance value of the device remained relatively stable. The computer-controlled MFC subsequently introduced CO gas into the sensor material. Upon contact with the sensor material, the gas molecules induced a change in the material's resistance. The analog collector measured and recorded the sensor's resistance change at five-second intervals. Once the resistance of the device stabilized, air was introduced for desorption. The gas response value is defined R: (1) R = Δ R / R 0 × 100 % Among them ΔR=R0-Rg. In the formula, R0 represents the real-time resistance value of the sensor in the test gas, and Rg represents the resistance value of the sensor in the carrier gas before the test gas is introduced. Response time is defined as implementing an adsorption gas sensor, the time needed for 90 % of the total resistance for desorption, defined as the recovery time [20]. The response size of the gas sensor indicates its ability to detect the target gas; Sensitivity (S) is defined as the rate of change of the response with the concentration of the test gas, expressed as: (2) S = ∂ R / ∂ C Where C represents the concentration of the test gas.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "PANI/Ti3AlC2/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite thin film sensor", "Syns_method": "chemical polymerization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "aniline", "amount": "100 μL"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ti3AlC2", "amount": "0.005 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "CeO2", "amount": "0.005 g"}, "prc4": {"name": "ammonium persulfate", "amount": "10 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "HCl", "amount": "20 mL (2 mol/L)"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "10 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "polymerize", "parameters": {"temperature": "0–5 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "centrifuge and wash", "parameters": {"solvent": "2M HCl and deionized water"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "drop-cast", "parameters": {"substrate": "IDE"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "room temperature", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "vacuum dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}}}

Chloroform, hexane, acetone, and ethanol were of analytical grade and purchased from various sources. Milli-Q water was obtained from a PURELAB flex from ELGA. An argon-filled glove box was used for storing and handling sensitive chemicals. 2.2 Synthesis of colloidal CoFe2O4 nanoparticles All the syntheses were performed using standard airless techniques, i.e. a vacuum/dry argon gas Schlenk line. CoFe2O4 NPs were synthesized by loading 1.0 mmol of Fe(acac)3, 1 mmol of Co(acac)2, 10 ml OAm and 1.0 ml OAc in a three-neck flask and degassed under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h while being strongly stirred using a magnetic bar. Subsequently, the reaction flask was heated to 230 °C and maintained for 30 min, while continuously adding nitrogen into the flask. A visible color change was observed immediately (see Scheme 1 ). The obtained NPs were collected by centrifuging and washing the solid product with acetone and hexane three times. The as-prepared NPs were finally dispersed in hexane with a concentration of 10 mg/mL and stored for further use. NPs were colloidally stable in chloroform for a couple of weeks. 2.3 Ligand removal In a typical process, 10 mL of CoFe2O4 NPs dispersion in hexane (10 mg/mL) was combined with 10 mL acetonitrile to form a two-phase mixture and then a 1 mL HBF4 solution (48%) was added. The resulting solution was sonicated until the NPs transferred from the upper to the bottom layer. The surface modified NPs were washed with ethanol for three times and dispersed in 10 mL ethanol with a small amount of DMF for further use. 2.4 Coating of Ni foam 2.4.1 Drop casting Ni foam was sonicated in acetone, 1 M HCl, Milli-Q water, and ethanol respectively. 50 μL of 10 mg/mL CoFe2O4 ethanol solution was dropped on nickel foam and dried in air and subsequently annealed at 400℃ under nitrogen atmosphere. 2.4.2 Dip coating Ni foam was sonicated in acetone, 1 M HCl, Milli-Q water, and ethanol respectively. In a typical process, clean and dry nickel foam was immersed in 10 mg/mL of CoFe2O4 ethanol solution for 2 s and then taken out quickly and dried in air. This process was repeated for 1, 3, 5, and 7 times and donated as 1 dip, 3 dips, 5 dips and 7 dips, respectively. The coated NFs were subsequently annealed at 400 ℃ under nitrogen atmosphere. After 3 dips the CoFe2O4 NP loading was 3.3 mg, about 1.15 mg/cm2. (Fig. S5). 2.5 Characterization Structural characterization was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The samples were scanned from 2θ = 20° to 80° at a rate of 0.02 s−1 in Bragg–Brentano geometry. The diffractometer was equipped with a Cu Kα (1.54051 Å) radiation source. The morphology of the as deposited foam-based electrodes was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and elemental analysis was performed by the same microscope equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were prepared by scratching the as-prepared CoFe2O4 powders from the Ni foam substrate, followed by dispersing them in hexane and collecting them on the TEM copper grids. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies were conducted by using an FEI Tecnai F20 field emission gun microscope operated at 200 kV with a point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm, which is equipped with high angle annular dark field (HAADF) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) detectors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done on a SPECS system equipped with an Al anode XR50 source operating at 150 mW and a Phoibos 150 MCD-9 detector. The pressure in the analysis chamber was below 10-7 Pa. The area analyzed was about 2 mm × 2 mm. The pass energy of the hemispherical analyzer was set at 25 eV and the energy step was set at 0.1 eV. Data processing was performed with the CasaXPS program (Casa Software Ltd., UK). Binding energy values were centered using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on an Alpha Bruker spectrometer The electrochemical performance of CoFe2O4@NF electrodes towards OER reduction was assessed using a three-electrode set-up. A leak-free Ag/AgCl 3.4 M KCl reference electrode (RE) was assembled in the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) frame of the cell and placed very close to the working electrode surface. The potential was transformed to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale: E (V RHE) = E (V Ag/AgCl) + 0.0592 × pH + 0.197. The data presented for the electrochemical characterization in aqueous solutions in three-electrode configuration do not include compensation for the series resistance of the solution. For the complete electrolyzer characterization, an adapted flow cell set-up (Micro Flow Cell, Electrocell A/S) was employed, schematically depicted in Fig. 7a. The flow rates of electrolytes within the flow cell were kept at 20 ml/min. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, the electrolyte was directly introduced through the macroporous 3D CoFe2O4@NF electrode (geometric surface area: 10 cm2). For details on the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and gas chromatography (GC) regarding the assessment of current-voltage behavior and the faradaic efficiency for gaseous products, respectively, the reader is referred to Ref. [41] and Ref. [42]. The electrically attached triple junction thin-film silicon device had an area of 1 cm2, thus during the photoelectrolysis measurement an area of 1 cm2 was illuminated. All photoelectrochemical experiments were conducted using a solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp. The intensity of the light source was adjusted to match standard AM 1.5 G sunlight at 100 mW/cm2 intensity. The experiments for the full system assembly were carried out in a two-electrode configuration. The faradaic efficiency to H2 was calculated using the analysis of the outlet gas by gas chromatography (GC) during potentiostatic measurements. Helium (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas. The calibration of peak area vs. gas concentration was used for the molar quantification of each gaseous effluent. The faradaic efficiency was calculated by determining the number of coulombs needed for each product and then dividing by the total charge passed during the time of the GC sampling according to the flow rate. In the photovoltaic-electrolyzer coupled system, to account for deviations in the assessment of the photovoltaic performance of the complete system, i.e. spectra variations due to diode calibration accuracy, area definition, or temperature variation, a systematic error of 2% was considered [25].", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "CoFe2O4", "Syns_method": "colloidal synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe(acac)3", "amount": "1.0 mmol"}, "prc2": {"name": "Co(acac)2", "amount": "1.0 mmol"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "oleylamine", "amount": "10 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "oleic acid", "amount": "1.0 mL"}}, "parameters": {"temperature": "230 °C", "time": "30 min"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ligand removal", "substance": [{"name": "HBF4", "amount": "1 mL (48%)"}, {"name": "acetonitrile", "amount": "10 mL"}]}, "post_proc2": {"step": "wash", "substance": [{"name": "ethanol"}]}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "CoFe2O4@NF", "Syns_method": "coating", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "CoFe2O4", "amount": "50 μL"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ni foam"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "ethanol", "amount": "10 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "400 °C"}}}}}}}

A comprehensive exploration of key factors such as the catalyst quantity, optimal instrumental parameters, scan rate influence, and pH effect was undertaken, revealing a well-regulated reaction process. Furthermore, the sensor's analytical performance parameters were determined. This included establishing the linear detection range for the target compound within a specified concentration interval of 2.92 nM to 4.97 μM. The detection limit of 0.91 nM, repeatability of 3.1%, and reproducibility of 4.8% of the sensor were calculated, leading to the observation of favorable stability characteristics. Conclusively, the developed electrochemical sensor was successfully employed for the quantification of niclosamide in urine samples and niclosamide tablets. This application highlighted not only the sensor’s high selectivity but also the satisfactory and accurate outcomes obtained from these measurements.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "NiO/Ni@C-Fe3O4/CeO2", "application": "detection of niclosamide", "props": {"linear_detection_range": "2.92 nM to 4.97 μM", "detection_limit": "0.91 nM", "repeatability": "3.1%", "reproducibility": "4.8%"}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "The superior mechanical properties and thermal stability of Ti-Al-Si-N coatings have attracted extensive research interests in academia as well as industry. In this study, Ti0.52Al0.48N, Ti0.53Al0.38Si0.09N, Ti0.43Al0.48Si0.09N, and Ti0.48Al0.38Si0.14N coatings are developed by arc-evaporation. This compositional variation allows to study the impact of Al and Si on structure, thermal stability, and oxidation behavior. Incorporation of Si into Ti-Al-N leads to a nanocomposite structure with an amorphous-like SiNx boundary-phase – encapsulating small crystalline Ti-Al-N grains – and promotes wurtzite-type AlN formation. This causes a significant change in the mechanical and thermal properties of the originally single-phase face-centered cubic structured Ti0.52Al0.48N. The Si-containing coatings experience an initial increase in hardness from 29.1 ± 1.0 GPa for Ti0.52Al0.48N to 33.1 ± 1.2 GPa for Ti0.53Al0.38Si0.09N, and then a decrease to 26.4 ± 0.8 GPa for Ti0.43Al0.48Si0.09N and 28.1 ± 0.8 GPa for Ti0.48Al0.38Si0.14N. Alloying with Si improves the thermal stability of Ti-Al-N by retarding the decomposition towards its thermodynamically stable constituents TiN and AlN. Moreover, the oxidation resistance of Ti-Al-N can be largely improved by the Si-addition due to the retarded anatase-to-rutile TiO2 transformation as well as the formation of a protective oxide scale at the nitride-to-oxide interface. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy studies reveal that the oxide scales of the Si-containing coatings exhibit a lamellar structure comprising Al-rich, TiSi-rich, and/or Ti-rich oxide layers. Higher Si and, especially, higher Al content is favorable to the formation of an Al-rich layer, which can act as a diffusion barrier for oxygen. Especially, all Si-containing coatings present an abnormal oxidation behavior, where the consumed nitride layer thickness is not continuously increasing with oxidation temperature.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Ti0.52Al0.48N", "application": "coatings for mechanical and thermal stability applications", "props": {"hardness": "29.1 ± 1.0 GPa"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Ti0.53Al0.38Si0.09N", "application": "coatings for mechanical and thermal stability applications", "props": {"hardness": "33.1 ± 1.2 GPa"}}, "MAT3": {"name": "Ti0.43Al0.48Si0.09N", "application": "coatings for mechanical and thermal stability applications", "props": {"hardness": "26.4 ± 0.8 GPa"}}, "MAT4": {"name": "Ti0.48Al0.38Si0.14N", "application": "coatings for mechanical and thermal stability applications", "props": {"hardness": "28.1 ± 0.8 GPa"}}}}

First, CNTs (LG Chem; purity: >97%; diameter: 8–12 nm; length: 5–8 μm; Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area: 220 m2 g−1) were dispersed in a solution of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), carboxymethyl cellulose(CMC), ethanol, and deionized water, producing a homogeneous CNT suspension. Si powder (Super Energy Material Inc., Taiwan; purity: >99.5%; D50: ∼100 nm) was then added into the above suspension, which was stirred for 1 h. Afterward, graphitic sheets (Taiwan Carbon Materials Corp.; purity: >99.5%; BET surface area: 10–15 m2 g−1) were introduced (with a graphitic sheet to CNT weight ratio of 50:1) and mixed by wet milling. The resulting solution was spray-dried to obtain a Si/CNT/G powdery sample. NCM-811 powder was purchased from Ubiq Technology Co. Ltd. Pyr12O1FTFSI IL was synthesized using procedures reported in a previous paper [35]. Pyr13FSI and Pyr13TFSI ILs (purity: 99.9%) were purchased from Solvionic and vacuum-dried at 80 °C for 24 h before use. Battery-grade LiFSI and LiTFSI were purchased from Kishida Chemical. All the electrolytes were prepared in an argon-filled glove box and dried over fresh molecular sieves before use. The water content of the electrolytes, measured using Karl Fisher titration, was below 20 ppm. 2.2 Cell assembly The negative electrode slurry was prepared by mixing 88 wt% Si/CNT/G powder, 1 wt% carbon black, and 11 wt% sodium polyacrylate binder in deionized water. The obtained slurry was cast onto Cu foil using a doctor blade and then vacuum-dried at 100 °C for 10 h. The Si/CNT/G mass loading was ∼2.5 mg cm−2. The positive electrode slurry was prepared by mixing 80 wt% NCM-811, 10 wt% Super P, and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride binder in N–methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The obtained slurry was cast onto Al foil and then vacuum-dried at 110 °C for 10 h. The NCM-811 mass loading was ∼5 mg cm−2. The electrodes were punched to match the required dimensions of a CR 2032 cell. Li foil and a glass fiber membrane were used as the counter electrode and separator, respectively. The assembly of the coin cells was conducted in an argon-filled glove box (Vigor Tech. Co. Ltd.), where both the moisture content and oxygen content were maintained at below 0.1 ppm. 2.3 Material and electrochemical characterizations The crystallinity of Si/CNT/G was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D2 PHASER). The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; FEI Inspect F50) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL 2100F). Raman data were collected using a LabRAM HR 800 spectrometer (with a laser wavelength of 633 nm). TGA (Perkin-Elmer TGA7) was conducted under air with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB Xi+) was employed to examine the surface chemical composition of various electrodes. Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) was used as the X-ray source. The data fitting was conducted using the XPSPEAK 4.1 software. The charge–discharge properties (such as capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability) of various cells were evaluated using an Arbin BT-2043 battery tester at 25 °C. The voltage ranges used for the Si/CNT/G and NCM-811 half cells were 0.05–2.0 V and 2.7–4.5 V, respectively. To construct Si/CNT/G||NCM-811 full cells with various electrolytes, an anode-to-cathode capacity ratio of ∼1.2 was used. The Si/CNT/G anode was pre-conditioned for three cycles and prelithiated by 20% in a half cell prior to the full cell assembly. For each testing condition, at least 5 duplicate cells were measured. The performance deviation was typically within 5%. The reported data are the median values. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out with a Biologic VSP-300 potentiostat in a frequency range of 106–10−2 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The thermal stability of the NCM-811 samples delithiated in various electrolytes was evaluated using DSC (Netzsch DSC3500) in a temperature range of 50–350 °C. The NCM-811 powder was recovered from the coin cells after delithiation to 4.5 V and then placed into Al capsules in the glove box without washing and drying.

The Ag2ZrO3 was prepared by calcination method as reported by Sanjay R. T et al. 10 mmol ZrOCl2·8H2O and 20 mmol AgNO3 were mixed by milling for 15 min in corundum mortar and the white emulsion slurry appeared (Thakare et al. 2015). After drying in an air oven at 70 °C, it was crushed into a fine powder. Then, the fine powder was shifted into corundum crucible and calcined at 900 °C for 12 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the brown fine powder was collected.\nPreparation of binary Ag2ZrO3/TiO2 composites\nOne hundred milligrams PVP was dispersed in 40 mL deionized water, and Ag2ZrO3 was mixed and agitated at room temperature for 15 min, then add 2 mmol TBOT and stir for 15 min, transfer the suspension to 50-mL Teflon airtight autoclave and continue to heat at 180 °C for 20 h. After cooling to room temperature, the final product samples were centrifuged and rinsed it thrice with ethanol and distilled water. After drying at 70 °C, the brown powder was obtained and expressed as X-AZT (X is the mole ratio of Ag2ZrO3 and TiO2, X = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0), respectively. Meanwhile, the pure TiO2 was also prepared in the same way without adding the Ag2ZrO3 power.\nCharacterization\nWe use the Bruker AxS D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation λ = 0.15406 nm) to characterize the XRD of the products. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM and HRTEM; JEM-2100, Japan) was applied to investigate the morphologies of TiO2, Ag2ZrO3, and Ag2ZrO3/TiO2 composites. The chemical modification of the material surface was probed through Britain Renishaw Raman spectrometer (with a solid-state laser, excitation at 514 nm, 20 mW) at room temperature in the range of 100~800 cm−1. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) data was acquired by a PHI Quantera II spectrometer, with Al Kα radiation. The UV-Vis spectrophotometer (EV 220, Thermo Scientific) was used to measure the light fascination properties, with BaSO4 disc as the standard sample. The PL (photoluminescence) spectra (Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) of the composites were measured on FluoroLog-3 spectrophotometer, and the excitation wavelength was 340 nm and the slits excitation and emission widths were 5.0 nm.\nElectrochemical analysis\nIn an ordinary three-electrode system, electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI660B electrochemical work station. The working electrodes were prepared by passing the samples on the glass-carbon electrodes. Before modifying the working electrode, the glass-carbon electrode needs to be ultrasonically cleaned and excited with K3[Fe(CN)6]/KCl (5 mM/0.1 M, the solution in deionized water). The catalyst was then dispersed in deionized water to form a suspension at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. After the suspension was sonicated for 10 min, 5 μL of the suspended material sample was finally plunged onto the electrode as the working electrode and dried at room temperature. Saturated calomel electrode was regarded as a reference electrode and a platinum wire as a counter electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was tested in 0.2 mM RhB solution (pH = 6.5 adjusted by Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4) with sweep rates of 0.1 V/s.\nPhotocatalytic performance\nThe photocatalytic properties of the manufactured samples were judged by disintegrating Rhodamine B (RhB) in aqueous solution on visible light. A 500-W xenon lamp was used as the light source, and a 420-nm filter was added to remove the ultraviolet light. Accurate measurement of 50 mg of catalyst was added in 50 mL of RhB (10 mg/ L) solution. The suspension was stirred in the darkroom for 30 min prior to visible radiation to achieve an adsorption-desorption equilibrium. During the photodegradation of RhB, 3.5 mL of the suspended solution was taken each 10 min and the catalyst was removed by centrifugation.

Further, the evolution of phase and nanostructure with temperature in the composite SiTiCNO ceramics was analyzed by the help of different characterization techniques, such as XRD, Raman, and electron microscopy. The Ti-doped SiCN ceramic system appeared as single-phase SiTiCNO amorphous up to 1100 °C. The phase separation of SiTiCNO ceramics started at 1200 °C and exhibited TiO2 nanocrystals distributed in the amorphous SiCN matrix. Ti-doping was found to accelerate the separation of the free carbon phase from the SiCN matrix, and the said carbon had better graphitic order in the Ti-doped SiCN samples as compared to the undoped SiCN of equivalent thermal history. At 1400 °C, high temperature stable phases such as TiC and TiC0.3N0.7 were formed along with predominant rutile-TiO2 phase within the Si–Ti–O–C–N composite.

A pinch of La-doping can prevent the migration of transition metal (TM) ions and stabilize crystal structure.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials The commercial carbon fiber cloth (Tengerhui Tech Co., Ltd, denoted as CFC) was cut into a rectangular shape with a length of 10 cm × 3 cm, which was used in the following pretreatment experiments. First, the cut CFC was ultrasonically alternated three times with deionized water and ethanol to remove impurities on its surface. Then, put the mixed acid (25 mL nitric acid with a mass fraction of 60% and 5 mL concentrated sulfuric acid with a mass fraction of 98%) and CFC together in an autoclave for a hydrothermal reaction at 150 °C for 12 h. Finally, the reactive CFC was washed with deionized water. 2.2 Synthesis of CFC@HP CFC@HP was synthesized through a simple esterification reaction. 0.5 g of hyperbranched polyester polyol (denoted as HP, Fig. S1) was dissolved in 10 mL of DMF solution. Pre-treated CFC was then added to the solution, accompanied by 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). The mass ratio of CFC to DMAP was about 1:1. Subsequently, the mixed solution was placed in an oil bath at 75 °C and stirred for 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h. The CFC loaded with HP was removed and dried naturally, and then washed alternately with deionized water and ethyl acetate, finally vacuum dried at 75 °C for 12 h. It is necessary to explain that, according to the different esterification reaction times, the CFC modified with HP are recorded as CFC@HP-12, CFC@HP-24, CFC@HP-36, and CFC@HP-48. Among them, the CFC with 24 h of esterification reaction time is chosen as a typical example to further study (it devoted as CFC@HP in the following text). 2.3 Synthesis of CFC-Li and CFC@HP-Li The as-prepared CFC and CFC@HP were placed in an Ar-filled glove box with the content of O2 and H2O below 0.01 ppm, and then rolled together with ultra-thin Li foil (99.9%, Tianjin Zhongneng Lithium Industry Co., Ltd.). The thickness of the ultra-thin Li foil is 100 µm, and its bulk density is 0.53 g cm−3. In the end, CFC-Li and CFC@HP-Li were cut into 8 mm diameter discs. The steps of CFC-Li and CFC@HP-Li were the same except for the difference of whether there was HP loaded or not. 2.4 Materials characterization The sample morphologies were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Nova NanoSEM450) using the high vacuum mode at room temperature and transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-ARF200F). In particular, for the recycled batteries, it is necessary to disassemble them in a glove box filled with argon before SEM characterization, and then gently rinse the electrode with diethyl carbonate to remove residual salt. The structural characteristics of the samples were analyzed via X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Philips, with Cu-Ka as the radiation source, λ = 0.15406 nm, the scanning rate of 5º min−1 and the scanning angle of 5º～90º) and Raman spectra (LabRAM HR800). Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXISULTRADLD) were used to obtain the information of surface chemistry, including element distributions content and chemical states of the products. FT-IR spectra were recorded using KBr pellets of the materials and JASCO FT/IR-4100 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a PerkinElmer TGA 4000 thermogravimetric analyzer from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in the nitrogen. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements To evaluate the electrochemical deposition behavior, galvanostatic cycle stability and Coulombic efficiency of Li metal anodes, CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (H2O < 0.01 ppm, O2 < 0.01 ppm). Polypropylene membrane (Celgard, 2400 PP) was used as the separator and the carbonate electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 1 M LiPF6 in EC/EMC (v/v=3:7). In addition, the amount of applied electrolyte in each cell was 75 µL. The cycle data of all batteries were collected by the LAND and Neware test system at room temperature. For the symmetric cell test, cells were manufactured by using two identical pure Li foils or two CFC-Li and CFC@HP-Li as working and counter electrodes to evaluate the cycling stability and voltage hysteresis. To further investigate the Coulombic efficiency of the batteries, Li//Cu half-cells were assembled using Li foils, CFC-Li and CFC@HP-Li as the working electrode and copper foil (12 mm in diameter) as the counter electrode. Prior to the test, the cells need to be electrochemically activated within the voltage range of 0 ~ 1.0 V at a low current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 for 5 cycles to stabilize the SEI and remove the surface impurities. The Li//LFP full batteries use pure Li or Li-deposited CFC and CFC@HP as the anode and LFP as the cathode. The LFP electrode was prepared by mixing LiFePO4, super P and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a ratio of 8:1:1 with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent. The mass loading of LFP was about 3 mg cm−2. According to the calculation, the areal mass loading of Li in CFC@HP-Li was 6.338 mg cm−2, however, the anode and cathode electrode areas were the same, so the calculated N/P ratio was about 2.113. Li//LFP full cells were subjected to constant current testing in the voltage range of 2.5–4.0 V at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). Among them, the CV curves were obtained using the Li//LFP full cells with various scan rates of 0.1 mV s−1 in the potential range of 2.5–4.0 V, and EIS measurements were conducted with a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "CFC@HP", "Syns_method": "esterification reaction", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "HP", "amount": "0.5 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C3H7NO", "amount": "10 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "wash", "substance": [{"name": "H2O"}, {"name": "ethyl acetate"}]}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "75 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "\n               Lithium-ion battery is a type of rechargeable battery commonly used for portable, electronics, and electric vehicles. The technology was developed by John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino during the period 1970–80 and then commercialized by Yoshio Nishi in 1991. A number of attempts have been made to improve the overall battery efficiency, capacity, and lifespan. There are many choices of materials for the positive and negative electrode materials, the electrolyte, and the separator. The electrolyte is an essential part of the battery, which provides ionic conductivity (Li+ ions) to exchange between the two electrodes. There are two major classes of electrolytes: (1) liquid electrolyte (aqueous and organic) and (2) solid (polymer and ceramic). Aqueous electrolytes are safer and have lower potential environmental impacts but have restricted electrochemical voltage window (1.23V). In order to achieve a wider electrochemical window, battery electrolytes are usually based on an organic solvent loaded with a lithium salt. Using appropriate blends of these solvents and salts, electrolytes with good electrochemical stability and with suitably high ionic conductivities are needed for a high-performance battery. Since the use of an organic liquid electrolyte poses an environmental contamination risk due to leakage, coupled with a flammability issue, the development of polymer electrolytes are promising alternatives to enhance the safety performance of batteries. Polymer gel electrolytes are attractive alternatives to the polymer–salt complexes particularly with regard to high ionic conductivity and emerging as useful materials for technological applications. The first lithium-conducting nonaqueous polymer gel electrolyte was reported by Feuillade and Perche in 1975. Despite their high conductivity at ambient temperatures, the mechanical properties of gel electrolyte still need further improvement. The dispersion of nanosized insulating particles may be one such alternative, which could result in an increase in ionic conductivity along with an improvement in mechanical properties. In this chapter, nanodispersed lithium ion-conducting nonaqueous polymer gel electrolytes obtained by dispersing nanofillers to the polymer gel electrolytes obtained by adding a suitable polymer to the solutions of lithium salts in different single/binary solvent mixtures have been discussed.\n            ", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "aqueous electrolyte", "application": "lithium-ion battery electrolyte", "props": {"electrochemical voltage window": "1.23 V"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "organic liquid electrolyte", "application": "lithium-ion battery electrolyte", "props": {}}, "MAT3": {"name": "nanodispersed lithium ion-conducting nonaqueous polymer gel electrolytes", "application": "lithium-ion battery electrolyte", "props": {}}}}

This synthesis procedure made nanopowders with higher surface area, higher crystallisation factor, smaller size and higher pore-diameter and pore-volume values and it also exhibited spherical shape with less cluster formation of the particles. In this method the cycles of compression and rarefaction were produced by the ultrasonic waves which further led to the generation of cavitation. This effect developed in the medium strengthened the dissolution of the reagents and enhanced the reaction rate between the liquid and solid reactants. The advantage of this method was that it allowed the control over various principal aspects such as; surface and particle areas and pore size and volume ratios, which further influenced the structural morphology of the synthesised TiO2 nanopowders [27, 28].

In this method the clustered form of the material was broken down into smaller sized nanoparticles. At first a stable colloidal dispersed solution of silver was obtained in water which further underwent reduction step using a reducing agent (sodium borohydride). This step led to the formation of the agglomeration of the nanoparticles and they were broken down into desired sized nano structures by heating. This process also allowed the production of the sample nanopowders on large scale [29,30,31].

In this study, we proposed a novel green method for the recycling of spent single-crystal LiNixCoyMn1−x−yO2 (NCM) materials. No additional compounds were induced during the direct calcination process to acquire regenerated cathode materials. The surface lithium compounds residues could be fully reutilized combined with an over-discharging pre-treatment, which allowed them to serve as a lithium supplement for the reconstruction of the NCM crystal structure and for the promotion of its electrochemical performance. Via this method, the electrochemical performance of spent cathode materials could be enhanced distinctly and the lithium contents could be reused with high efficiency to alleviate resource shortages. Lithium vacancies were replenished with the decomposition of surficial lithium impurities, and the regenerated NCM exhibited improved cycling stability (129.1 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 200 cycles) with a well-ordered layered structure compared with spent NCM. Further, the composition and structure evolution of the spent NCM during the regeneration process was also investigated comprehensively combined with in situ XRD characterization. The layered structure of spent NCM remained unchanged, and the regenerated NCM showed bigger lattice parameters, confirming the lithium transmission to reconstruct the lattice structure occurred without phase transformation during the calcination process.

Initially a three-dimensional (3D) and a two-dimensional (2D) model was developed based on Figs. 1 and 2a, consisting of electrodes on top and bottom of the composite layer with nanoparticles inclusion. The side-wall of the models were considered as a periodic boundary condition. A unit input voltage Vin with frequency f was applied on the electrodes, and the resultant complex terminal current, I(ω), was measured from COMSOL. Finally, Eqs. (7)–(9) was utilized to evaluate the dielectric functions of the composites. Notice, COMSOL inherently considers all 2D models with a unit depth. As a result, the dielectric materials surface area A becomes d, and the Eqs. (7)–(8) further simplifies. The 2D and 3D models were compared in the subsequent section, and eventually, the 2D model was utilized since the 3D model was found to be computationally expensive. The effect of nanoparticles type, size, and volume fraction was varied on the COMSOL model for analysis. The polymer matrix component was fixed as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) for all nanocomposites, and the nanoparticles were changed solely. Five different nanoparticles were considered, including semiconductor material silicon (Si), inorganic zinc-sulfide (ZnS), metal Gold (Au), metal-oxide titanium-oxide (TiO2), and dielectric fillers barium-titanate (BaTiO3) (BT). Notice that the dielectric function of nanoparticles is also frequency-dependent; however, the dipole relaxation of such components occurs at a much higher frequency than space-charge relaxation. Thus, a constant electrical property was considered for these particles in COMSOL simulation.

This process closely correlates with the occurrence, development, invasion, and metastasis of various tumors, each exhibiting diverse levels of MMP-9 expression. However, the accuracy of detection results using the single-mode method is compromised due to the coexistence of multiple biologically active substances in the ECM. Results Therefore, in this study, a tri-modal detection system is proposed to obtain more accurate information by cross-verifying the results. Herein, we developed a tri-modal assay using the ZIF-8@Au NPs@S QDs composite as a multifunctional signal probe, decorated with DNA for the specific capture of MMP9. Notably, the probe demonstrated high conductivity, fluorescence response and mimicked enzyme catalytic activity. The capture segments of hybrid DNA specifically bind to MMP9 in the presence of MMP9, causing the signal probe to effortlessly detach the sensor interface onto the sample solution. Consequently, the sensor current performance is weakened, with the colorimetric and fluorescent signals becoming stronger with increasing MMP9 concentration. Notably, the detection range of the tri-modal sensor platform spans over 10 orders of magnitude, verifying notable observations of MMP-9 secretion in four tumor cell lines with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, the reliability of the detection results can be enhanced by employing pairwise comparative analysis.

Single crystalline Si (100) wafers and 304 stainless steels were used as substrates. The deposition chamber was initially evacuated to 5 × 10−4 Pa and the substrate was heated to 300 °C. Argon (Ar) was introduced into the chamber and the pressure was maintained at 1 Pa to perform a glow discharge etching process for 10 min at a bias voltage of −250 V. Subsequently the bias voltage and chamber pressure were reduced to −60 V and 0.5 Pa respectively. During deposition, the substrate holder rotated at a speed of 15 r/min. The Al60Cr20Ti20 target was powered at 150 W to deposit a metallic AlCrTi transition layer over 15 min to enhance adhesion strength. Nitrogen (N2) was then introduced into the chamber at a pressure of 0.5 Pa with an N2/Ar ratio of 1:3. The bias voltage was set to −90 V, and the sputtering power of the Si target was varied (0, 50, 100 or 150 W) to synthesize the AlCrTiN and AlCrTiSiN coatings with different Si contents.

Cross-sectional samples were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB, Thermofisher Scios) and observed with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F30). The hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E*) of the coatings were measured using a nano-indenter (TTX-NHT, CSM). The maximum load applied was 10 mN, with a dwell time of 10 s.

However, lithium dendrites generated by the uneven Li deposition during cycling seriously threaten the safety of the battery and limit its commercial application. Herein, we propose a novel and facile strategy by adding Cu(NO3)2 additive in carbonate electrolyte, which effectively inhibits the growth of lithium dendrites and prolongs the lifespan of LMBs based on LiMn2O4 as 4 V class cathode. Due to the contribution of Cu(NO3)2, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is rapidly and stably formed attaching on lithium metal without evident lithium dendrites.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemical material Natural MoS2 (NM) is prepared from natural molybdenum ore in Jinduicheng, Shaanxi Province. Chemical reagent: Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4· 7H2O), Ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), Terephthalic acid (1, 4－H2BDC), N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF). The degradation of NMF was evaluated with tetracycline (TC) as the representative dye. The pH of the TC solution is adjusted by hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used in the Fenton reaction experiment (H2O2 n, 30%). Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), tert-butanol (TBA) and benzoquinone (BQ) were used as scavengers of vacancy, hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical, respectively. Both deionized and ultra-pure water were used in each experiment. 2.2 Catalysts preparation Preparation of natural molybdenum ore: Use the crusher to crush natural molybdenum ore at a speed of 5000 r/min and the running time is 10 min. Then it is screened with a 300-mesh screen to obtain a mineral powder material with a particle size of less than 48 μm. Natural molybdenum ore powder with particle size less than 45 μm is washed and centrifuged 3 times with anhydrous ethanol and ultra-pure water, and then dried for 12 h in a drying oven with blast air at 70 °C. Then it is ground to produce a black MoS2 (NM) powder. Preparation of MIL101(Fe): Dissolve 1.5 g FeCl3·6H2O into 80 mL N, n-dimethylformamide (DMF). After stirring for 20 min, add 0.93 g terephthalic acid and continue stirring for 10 min until completely dissolved. After the yellow clarified solution is obtained, the solution is transferred to a stainless steel high-pressure reactor with 100 mL polytetrafluoroethylene lining, which is cooled naturally after hydrothermal reaction for 12 h. After separating the brick-red precipitate at the bottom, the solution is alternately washed 3 times with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol. The obtained products were dried in vacuum at 70 °C for 12 h to remove the residual organic molecules in the pores, and then ground with a mortar to obtain MIL101(Fe) material. Preparation of MoS2/MIL101(Fe): 1.5 g FeCl3·6H2O and 1 g terephthalic acid (1, 4-H2BDC) were dispersed into 70 mL DMF to form a uniform solution. Then 0.026 g, 0.052 g, 0.078 g, 0.104 g and 0.13 g MoS2 were dispersed into the mixture and evenly mixed. The above solution was put into 100 mL of polytetrafluoroethylene inner tank, and then loaded into a high-pressure reactor, and reacted at 150 °C for 12 h. After the high-pressure reactor cooled to room temperature, the samples were taken out, centrifuged and washed with ethanol and DMF for 3 times. Finally, the separated solids are dried overnight in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C. The MoS2/MIL101(Fe) nanocomposites of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% were obtained and marked as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The preparation process of MMLF is as shown in Scheme 1 . 2.3 Catalytic performance testing Photo-Fenton degradation on TC was accomplished under visible light irradiation using a 500 W xenon lamp (The xenon lamp is equipped with a filter in front of the focusing lens to filter out ultraviolet light). An amount of catalyst was dispersed into 100 mL of TC solution for each experiment. Before irradiation, dark stirring was maintained at room temperature for about 20 min to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium. The effect of pH on the photo-Fenton degradation process was investigated by varying the pH value. The effect of H2O2 on the photo-Fenton degradation process was investigated by varying the concentration of H2O2. The effect of catalyst dose on the photo-Fenton degradation process was explored by varying the catalyst dose. The effect of the initial concentration of tetracycline on the photo-Fenton degradation process was explored by varying the initial concentration of tetracycline. During the reaction process, 5 mL of the reaction solution was collected every 20 min. The solution was centrifuged at 10,000 r/min for 10 min. The supernatant was taken and the residual TC in it was detected by a Purkinje UV1901 UV–vis spectrophotometer with a characteristic absorbance of 357 nm. Each experiment was repeated three times and the mean value was taken for analysis. 2.4 Characterization The crystal structure of the catalyst was tested using an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD-7000, Japan) with a Cu Kα light source (λ = 0.154 nm); the morphology and microstructure of the samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope (JSM7500F, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (APREO S, Netherlands); the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR. Tensor 27, Germany) to characterize the functional groups contained on the surface of the samples; solid UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV2550, Japan) was used to test the light absorption properties, the reference standard was BaSO4 and the scanning range was 200–800 nm. Electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, China) was used to test the photoelectric properties of the catalysts, using FTO glass as the working electrode, Pt electrode and Ag/AgCl electrodes as counter and reference electrodes, 0.5 mol/L Na2SO4 solution as electrolyte and a 300 W xenon lamp as the test light source.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "NM", "Syns_method": "mechanical processing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "crush", "parameters": {"speed": "5000 r/min", "time": "10 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "screen", "parameters": {"mesh": "300", "particle_size": "<48 μm"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash", "substance": [{"name": "anhydrous ethanol"}, {"name": "ultra-pure water"}], "parameters": {"cycles": "3"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "MIL101(Fe)", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "FeCl3·6H2O", "amount": "1.5 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "1,4-H2BDC", "amount": "0.93 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMF", "amount": "80 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal reaction", "parameters": {"time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "wash", "substance": [{"name": "deionized water"}, {"name": "anhydrous ethanol"}], "parameters": {"cycles": "3"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "MoS2/MIL101(Fe)", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "FeCl3·6H2O", "amount": "1.5 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "1,4-H2BDC", "amount": "1 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "MoS2", "amount": "0.026 g"}, "prc4": {"name": "MoS2", "amount": "0.052 g"}, "prc5": {"name": "MoS2", "amount": "0.078 g"}, "prc6": {"name": "MoS2", "amount": "0.104 g"}, "prc7": {"name": "MoS2", "amount": "0.13 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMF", "amount": "70 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal reaction", "parameters": {"temperature": "150 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "wash", "substance": [{"name": "ethanol"}, {"name": "DMF"}], "parameters": {"cycles": "3"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "overnight"}}}}}}}

However, the challenges in identifying the optimal conditions for critical factors, particularly the quantitative correlation between the modulator and crucial independent variables influencing MOFs performance, underscore the importance of research work in this field. Methods This study synthesized tin-based MOFs (Sn-MOFs) utilizing a linker derived from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste. A hydrothermal approach was employed, utilizing water-like solvents and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as a modulator to effectively induce structural defects. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate the effects and interactions of temperature, reaction time, and TFA concentration on optimizing yield and crystalline index (CI) while simultaneously reducing the residual percentage of 1,4-benzene dicarboxylate (H2BDC) in the Sn-MOFs (DI). Significant findings The research revealed that temperature, reaction time, and TFA concentration significantly influenced the performance of Sn-MOFs, highlighting the considerable potential of TFA in creating active sites and enhancing the surface area and pore volume of Sn-MOFs through defect engineering. Optimal synthesis conditions for Sn-MOFs included a temperature of 148℃, a reaction time of 24 h, and a molar ratio of H2BDC/TFA of 1.7, yielding 98.51 ± 1.47 % for yield and 80.21 ± 1.32 % for CI, with no detectable residual H2BDC.

Commonly used subunit vaccines comprising one or multiple recombinant proteins isolated from a pathogen demonstrate a better safety profile than live or attenuated vaccines. However, the immunogenicity of these vaccines is weak, and therefore, subunit vaccines require a series of doses to achieve sufficient immunity against the pathogen. Here, we show that the biomimetic mineralization of the inert model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) significantly improves the humoral immune response over three bolus doses of OVA (OVA 3×). Encapsulation of OVA in ZIF-8 (OVA@ZIF) demonstrated higher serum antibody titers against OVA than OVA 3×. OVA@ZIF vaccinated mice displayed higher populations of germinal center (GC) B cells and IgG1+ GC B cells as opposed to OVA 3×, indicative of class-switching recombination. We show that the mechanism of this phenomenon is at least partly owed to the metalloimmunological effects of the zinc metal as well as the sustained release of OVA from the ZIF-8 composite.

A 0.1 mL sample was added into 2 mL of BCA reagent, and then incubated at 60 °C for 30 min prior to UV–VIS spectrophotometric measurement at 562 nm. The enzyme encapsulation efficiency was computed by the following equation [6,23]: Enzyme encapsulation efficiency \\% = ( C 0 V 0 - C 1 V 1 ) C 0 V 0 × 100 % where C 0 and C 1 are the enzyme concentration of the supernatant before and after encapsulation, respectively; and V 0 and V 1 correspond to the initial and final volumes of the enzyme solution, respectively. 2.3 Characterization of lipase-encapsulated ZIF-8 Interior structure inspection was carried out on a JEOL JEM-2100 LaB6 transmission electron microscopy instrument (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA, USA). The accelerating voltage was set at 200 kV. A drop (∼5μL) of synthesized samples was dispersed into anhydrous ethanol (0.1 wt%), and then added on a formvar-carbon coated TEM grid (300-mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and air-dried at ambient temperature. The decomposition of lipase@ZIF-8 (∼0.1 g) was conducted with 200 μL of acetic acid for 5 min prior to performing gel electrophoresis on a Bio-Rad Mini-Protein apparatus III. Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast gel (Cat #456–8084) was applied to separate lipase. After separation, the gel was first stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 40 min and then destained with methanol and acetic acid. The ς-potential of the samples was measured via a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 system employing deionized water as dispersant at room temperature (21 °C). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples was collected in the frequency range of 400–4000 cm−1 using a Varian 600-IR FT-IR (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with 128 scans at a resolution of 2 cm−1. Thereafter, the quantitative information of the secondary structure of lipase was obtained by analyzing the second derivative spectra of amide I region (1600–1700 cm−1) following the Savitsky-Golay method. Curve fitting of the amide I absorption profile was performed as a linear combination of Gaussian components, and areas under the multicomponent peaks were estimated. Powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) patterns of ZIF-8 and lipase@ZIF-8 were recorded via a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K α radiation ((λ = 1.5405 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA). The diffractograms were collected from 5 to 50° (2θ) at a scanning rate of 4°/min. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of ZIF-8 and lipase@ZIF-8 was performed using a TA-instruments Q500 (New castle, DE, USA) thermogravimetric analyzer. The sample (ca. 10 mg) was filled into an alumina crucible, which was then heated from 30 °C to 900 °C at a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C/min under a 40 mL/min nitrogen flow. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of ZIF-8 and lipase@ZIF-8 were recorded at 77.3 K on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 and Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ analyzer (Norcross, GA, USA) after the as-synthesized samples (ca. 150 mg) were activated at 150 °C under dynamic vacuum overnight. Specific surface areas were reckoned by the 11-point Brunauer − Emmett − Teller (BET) method in the relative pressure (P/P0) ranging from 0.04 − 0.30. The micro- and meso-porosities and the pore size distributions were assessed by Horvath-Kawazoe (HJ) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, respectively. 2.4 Activity of the immobilized lipase The catalytic activities of lipase@ZIF-8 were assessed by lipase-mediated hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-palmitate (pNP-palmitate) [6,24]. An emulsion of the substrate was set up by mixing the following solutions: A: pNP-palmitate were added into 10 mL isopropanol to obtain substrate stock solution (0–10 mmol/L); B: 0.1 g Arabic gum and 0.4 mL of Triton X-100 in 90 mL phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 10 mM, pH 7.0). Then, 1 mL of the substrate emulsion was pipetted into a PMMA cuvette, and hydrolysis of pNP-palmitate was then initiated by adding 100 μL of the diluted lipase solution (0.0165 mg/mL) or equivalent lipase@ZIF-8 dispersants. The absorption spectra of the released p-nitrophenol were recorded at 405 nm on Duetta fluorescence and absorbance spectrometer (Horiba Scientific, NJ, USA) in 10 min by time-scanning method, and the initial velocity of lipase-mediated hydrolysis was determined by Michaelis-Menten curve. The apparent activation energy (Ea) could be reckoned by the Arrhenius function. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) for p-nitrophenol at 405 nm is 18.5 mM−1 cm−1. One unit of enzyme activity (U) was defined as the amount of the biocatalyst required to liberate 1 µmol of p-nitrophenol per min under the standard assay condition. The relative activity was defined as the ratio of the initial activity to the specific activity at their optimum conditions. 2.5 Temperature and pH resistance, storage stability, and reusability The temperature dependence (25 to 80 °C) of the catalytic activity of free lipase and lipase@ZIF-8 was examined spectrophotometrically in 10 min using pNP-palmitate as the substrate. In short, the pNP-palmitate stock solution (6 mmol/L) was developed in isopropanol, and the emulsion of the substrate was designed in PBS (10 mM, pH 7.0) as described above. Likewise, the impact of pH on the activity of both free lipase and lipase@ZIF-8 was investigated following the same protocols except the emulsion of the substrate was prepared in different buffer solutions (10 mM, pH 6.0–10.0) at room temperature. Lipase activities under different conditions were measured according to the standard procedure described above. Thermal stability of the lipase@ZIF-8 biocomposite was examined at 50 °C in a certain time interval. The pH stability of immobilized lipase was likewise evaluated in the range of pH 6.0–10.0. The lipase@ZIF-8 and free lipase were dispersed into 10 mM PBS for 24 h at 4 °C, followed by activity measurement at ambient temperature (pH = 7.0) after incubation. The storage stability of the lipase@ZIF-8 was assessed at 4 °C for 12 days. To evaluate the reusability of immobilized lipases, the hydrolysis of p-NPP into p-nitrophenol was conducted for 8 cycles at the optimized reaction conditions. After each cycle, the immobilized lipases were retrieved, rinsed with PBS (pH 7.0, 10 mM) and immersed into fresh substrate for the next cycle. The residual activities are computed based on section 2.4. 2.6 Biodiesel production For chemical transesterification [22], hemp oil (0.01 g) was incubated with 5 mL of 2% sulfuric acid–methanol solution in screw-capped test tubes at 100 °C for 30 min. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were subsequently extracted with hexane after cooling to room temperature (21 °C) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. FAME derived from hemp oil was quantified by a Shimadzu gas chromatography (GC 2014, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). In short, 1 μL of FAME was injected into the GC which was separated via a Supelco SP-2380 capillary GC column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.20 μm, Supelco inc., USA). The FAME profile was identified with 37-component FAME standard mix (C4-C24). For lipase-catalyzed transesterification, hemp oil (0.5 g), lipase@ZIF-8 composite (100 mg), and water (5 wt% based on oil weight) were transferred in screw-capped tubes, and the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 48 h with constant shaking at 200 rpm. In the process of the transesterification, 140 µL of methanol was added in three-steps at the points-in-time of 0, 12 and 24 h. The resultant FAME was analyzed as described above. Herein, biodiesel yield is defined as the ratio of FAME derived from the lipase-mediated transesterification to that from the chemical transesterification which theoretically renders the complete conversion of the fatty acids into FAME. The yield FAME end-products including C13-C22 fatty acids were calculated as follows: B io d i e s e l y i e l d ( % ) = ∑ C i × V × M m CT × 100 % where mCT is the mass of the FAMEs derived from chemical transesterification. Ci, V and M represent the molar concentration of a FAME from lipase-mediated transesterification, total volume of yield biodiesel, and the molar mass of a FAME, respectively. To determine the reusability of immobilized lipase, the biocatalyst lipase@ZIF-8 was recovered using centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min), thoroughly washed with n-hexane for three times, and dried at ambient temperature. The reusability of lipase@ZIF-8 was assessed in the 5 cycles with fresh substrates under the same transesterification conditions by measuring the relative biodiesel yield as compared to the initial yield. The catalytic activity recovery of lipase@ZIF-8 were assessed by lipase-mediated hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-palmitate (pNP-palmitate) based on the section 2.4. 2.7 Statistical analysis All characterizations and measurements were performed with at least triplicate samples unless otherwise specified. The values were shown as means ± SD of triplicates from each of two fresh samples. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to determine the significant differences between the samples (version 9.4, SAS institute Inc. Cary, NC). The differences between means were assessed using Tukey’s test with a significance level of p < 0.05.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "lipase@ZIF-8", "Syns_method": "bottle-around-ship", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "lipase", "amount": "40 μL"}, "prc2": {"name": "PVP", "amount": "100 μL"}, "prc3": {"name": "2-Mim", "amount": "20 mL"}, "prc4": {"name": "Zn(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "20 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "methanol", "amount": "40 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"speed": "800 rpm", "time": "1 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "incubate", "parameters": {"temperature": "21 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "centrifugation", "parameters": {"rpm": "10,000", "time": "10 min", "cycles": "3"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "21 °C"}}}}}}}

Briefly, the MAX was immersed in an in-situ HF solution (containing 1 g LiF and 20 ml 9 M HCl) and stirred 24 h at 35 oC.

For the pretreatment process, the spent LIBs collected from a LIB recycling company were first discharged in 1 M NaCl solution and then dismantled. After that, the cathode plates were separated and collected. The LIB cathode plates were further crushed into tiny scraps, with a specific area of ∼1 cm2. After that, 15 mL of deionized (DI) water and 10 mL of 5 M HCl were mixed with 1 gram of the obtained cathode plates in a beaker and magnetically stirred for 24 h. Most of the LIB cathode plates were dissolved. Afterward, a mixture solution containing Li, Al, Ni, Co, and Mn metal elements was obtained after filtration, and the ion concentrations are listed in Table S1.† In this study, two kinds of spent LIBs with different chemical compositions (i.e., LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) were employed to investigate the universality of the proposed “waste-to-value” strategy. The leachate of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 were used to prepare NCMB-1, while NCMB-2 was obtained using LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as the precursor.\nIn a typical boriding process, 20 mL of obtained leachate was added in a glass round-bottom flask, which was further diluted to a fixed volume of 100 mL with deionized water. 1 mL of solution was collected to estimate the ion concentrations before the reaction. Then, the solution was stirred vigorously under N2 flow for 30 min. Next, 30 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution containing excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was added to the solution by a syringe at a speed of 5 mL s−1, in an ice-water bath. A rapid formation of black precipitates was observed. Next, the solution was stirred at the same speed for another 30 min to guarantee complete boriding. Afterward, the vessel was kept still for 12 h, and a small volume of solution was collected with a syringe to test the ion concentrations after the reaction. The generated black precipitates were then collected from the solution and washed with ethanol and DI water thoroughly. At last, the products were dried using a vacuum drying oven at a temperature of 40 °C. As mentioned above, two borides (NCMB-1, NCMB-2) were prepared by the same processing steps but with different LIB precursors.\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a Rigaku Smart Lab X-ray diffractometer operating at 45 kV and 20 mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at a scan rate of 5° min−1 and a step size of 0.04°. The samples were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Sigma 500) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN; 200 kV) with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo K-Alpha+; Al (Kα) radiation (hv = 1486.6 eV)) was used to analyze the elemental composition and surface chemistry. The ion concentrations of the solution before and after the boriding process were tested via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 7700 s), and the dissolved ion concentrations in electrolytes after the electrochemical test were also tested with ICP-MS. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was performed using a Varian 720 instrument to calculate the chemical composition of the samples. The experimental parameters of ICP-MS and ICP-OES were listed in Table S2.†\nThe electrochemical measurements were performed in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with a Hg/HgO reference electrode and a graphite rod as a counter electrode. To fabricate the working electrode, 5 mg of the powder sample was added to the mixed solution (0.05 mL of Nafion solution (5 wt%), 0.45 mL of ethanol, and 0.5 mL of DI water), and the mixture was then ultrasonicated for half an hour. After that, 0.1 mL of the obtained ink was drop-coated on nickel foam (NF). Electrocatalytic OER activities were studied by recording linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) after the initial 20 cyclic voltammetric (CV) scans, at 5 mV s−1. In this study, to eliminate the solution resistance, the LSV curves were calibrated with iR compensation at a level of 90%. All potentials measured were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The overpotential (η) was calculated through η (V) = ERHE − 1.23 V.

In previous studies, DAK was utilized as eco-friendly cementitious materials, but only 10 wt% was used instead of cement as DAK's high percentage has a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties, so the environmental problem of DAK has not yet been solved. In this study, commercial titanium oxide (TiO2) was incorporated in a cement matrix containing DAK that reached 50 wt% to benefit from TiO2's properties in enhancing the mechanical performance of binding materials and producing cementitious blends used as blocking materials against harmful gamma radiation. Five pastes were prepared to reach the main target; ordinary Portland cement (OPC), OPC-10%DAK (D10), OPC-30%DAK (D30), OPC-50%DAK (D50) and OPC-45%DAK-5%TiO2 (D45-T5). By means of a mini-slump test, all fresh blends have very close flowability using the appreciated additions of polycarboxylate superplasticizer. The hardened composites were cured in tap water for up to 28-days. Compressive strength results at 28 days for OPC, D10, D30 and D50 were 80, 94.6, 60.8 and 57.6 MPa, respectively. An obvious turning point in strength value from 57.6 to 88 MPa after replacement of DAK by 5 wt% TiO2 (D45-T5). A gamma-ray shielding test was performed using two radioactive isotopes (Co-60 and Cs-137). The inclusion of 5% TiO2 has a great impact on the development of shielding power of D45-T5 compared with OPC; the linear attenuation coefficient (µ) values were enhanced from 0.127 ± 0.003 cm−1 to 0.199 ± 0.007 cm−1 at 661.6 Kev and from 0.118 ± 0.003 cm−1 to 0.144 ± 0.005 cm−1 at 1332.5 Kev. The unique properties of specimens containing the anatase phase may be attributed to the fact that the TiO2 may act as a nano-filler and active seeds for the formation of further hydration products such as CSHs, CAHs and CASHs as detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analyses techniques (TGA/DSC) and scanning electron microscope (SEM/EDX).

The procedures are described in detail in ESI.†\nThe pH dependence of the amount of released linkers was determined using a procedure published by Klet et al.74 and further elaborated by our group.54 A beaker was charged with 50 mg of activated MOF (heated at 120 °C, 4 h, dynamic vacuum) and 50 mL of water, followed by 3 min of sonication to obtain a suspension that did not sediment within several minutes. The suspension was then stirred, and the pH was adjusted by the addition of 0.1 M NaOH using an automatic titrator Metrohm 906 Titrando. In each step, 0.005 mL of the NaOH solution was added with the rate of addition set to 0.04 mL min−1. During the titration, the pH value gradually increased, and a 0.2 mL sample was taken immediately after reaching a preset pH value. The samples were immediately filtered through a PTFE microfilter (Whatman, 0.2 μm) and analysed using HPLC. These experiments provided data on the immediate release of the linkers at a certain pH; however, the kinetics of the linker release are not reflected in the results.\nThe same procedure was utilized for the determination of the immediate linker solubility at different pHs. 50 mg of the linker was mixed with 50 mL of water, followed by 3 min of sonication, and after that, the suspension of the linker in water was stirred for 2 h to achieve the equilibrium concentration at 25 ± 1 °C. The immediate solubility of the linker during titration experiments indicates how the linker release from the MOF structures is limited by the linker solubility.\nThe kinetic stability of selected MOFs was studied at the natural pH of the MOF suspensions and at pH 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0. In the case of MIP-200, a pH value of 12.0 was also used. In each kinetic experiment, 250 mg of MOF was suspended in water and sonicated for 3 min. The exact amount of added water was calculated for each pH to provide the total volume of 250 mL after the addition NaOH. After that, 0.1 M NaOH solution was added to reach the target pH value. The pH was kept constant during the kinetic experiments using an automatic titrator (Metrohm 906 Titrando) which continuously adjusted pH with 0.1 M NaOH. The samples (0.2 mL) were taken out within 0 to 240 min (the periods were shorter during the first 60 min to achieve better rendering of the kinetic curves), filtered through PTFE microfilters (Whatman, 0.2 μm), and analysed by HPLC. Each kinetic experiment was repeated at least three times. After the kinetic experiments, the residual solids were collected by centrifugation (4000 rpm, Hermle ZK 496), washed three times with water and five times with acetone, air-dried, and reactivated by vacuum-drying at 120 °C. Only in the case of MIP-200, the samples were air-dried and reactivated under a vacuum only at laboratory temperature because at higher temperatures, MIP-200 recrystallizes, see below. All these samples were analysed by XRPD, N2 adsorption, FTIR, and TGA/DTA, and the composition was determined by dissolving 10 mg of solid in 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH and subsequent analysis of the solution. All released carboxylic acids were determined by HPLC-DAD. The metal content was determined after the acidic dissolution of 10 mg of the sample by ICP-MS analysis. Analogous analyses were also performed with the parent MOFs.\n", "output": {}}

We wish to introduce the “paired electrodeposition” (PED) technique as a new method for the simultaneous synthesis and deposition of the MOF thin films (MOFTFs). This protocol implements the uniform pattern of two MOFTF modified substrates by “convergent (CPED: Zna/Znc-MOFTFs) and divergent (DPED: Cua/Znc-MOFTFs) paired electrodeposition” via a one-step synthesis. With the rule of thumb, enhanced energy efficiency and atom economy, increasing electrochemical yield, time-saving along with a variety of products are advantages of this technique. Besides, the “Electrode Modification Efficiency” has introduced for the evaluation of functionality and modification efficiency of electrochemical heterogeneous systems, especially MOFTFs.

To prepare a precursor solution of electrospinning process, 10 wt% polyacrylonitrile (PAN, Mw = 150,000 g mol−1, Aldrich) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Aldrich) and stirred for 24 h. Then, the prepared solution was placed into a 10 mL syringe with a 23 gauge needle and connected to the syringe pump. During the electrospinning process, feeding rate, needle/collector gap, and voltage were maintained at 0.03 mL h−1, 15 cm, and 13 kV, respectively. As-spun PAN-based nanofibers on the Al collector were collected and carbonized at 800°C nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h after stabilizing at 280°C in air. The resultant CNFs were set aside for further ALD process. 2.2 ALD coating process Due to several advantages of ALD, such as precise thickness control, large area uniformity, and highly conformal deposition, we employed the thermal ALD technique to deposit a ZnO, ZnS, and ZnOS lamination layer onto the as-prepared CNF. All ALD deposition temperatures were 140°C. During the ZnO ALD process, conventional diethylzinc [Zn(C2H5)2, or DEZn] and H2O have been used as zinc and oxygen precursors, respectively. Precursors are delivered from bubblers, using nitrogen as a carrier gas, and transported to the reactor through heated lines, to prevent condensation. The DEZ and H2O bubblers are controlled by the Peltier device at 12°C and 15°C, respectively. The cycles of DEZn and H2O exposure were 125. The ZnS ALD process and cycle are the same as the ZnO ALD process, but sulfur precursors were used instead of oxygen precursors. The ZnS layer was deposited using DEZn and H2S gas reactants as precursors. The ZnOS lamination layer was deposited by the number of subcycles, which is an alternating cycle method of ZnO and ZnS. The combination of ZnO and ZnS were grown using nine cycles of ZnS ALD followed by a one cycle of ZnO ALD. 2.3 Characterizations The structural properties and surface morphology of all the samples were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi SU–8010) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM–2100F) inclusive of energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. To characterize the thermal decomposition behavior, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were conducted up to 800°C at a heating rate of 10°C min−1. The crystallographic and chemical bonding states were analyzed using X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD, Rigaku D/Max–2500) with Cu Kα radiation and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250) with Al Kα radiation. To investigate the electrochemical performance, an anode was fabricated with all prepared samples. For preparing the slurries, the weight ratio of active material: conductive material (ketjen black): binder (PVDF) was 7:1:2 with an N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone solvent. The prepared slurries were coated on the copper foil current collector using doctor blade method and then dried in an oven for 10 h at 100°C. To compare the accurate electrochemical performances, the loading mass of active materials for all the samples were fixed to ~2 mg. Coin-type cells (CR2032, Hohsen Corp.) were assembled with 1.6 M LiPF6 in a mixture of dimethyl carbonate and ethylene carbonate (3:7) as a electrolyte, prepared electrodes as an anode, Li metal foil (Honjo Chemical Corp., 99.999%) as the counter electrode, and a porous polypropylene membrane (Celgrad 2400) as a separator.

For Li||LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) cells, an NMC622 cathode (specific capacity: 175 mAh g−1) was prepared by coating an Al foil with a slurry composed of 93 wt% NMC622, 3 wt% conductive carbon (super-P), and 4 wt% PVDF binder, followed by drying at 100 °C under vacuum for 24 h. The mass loading was controlled at ~ 12.5 mg cm−2, which corresponded to an areal capacity of ~ 2.0 mAh cm−2. The cells were cycled at various C rates within the voltage range of 2.8–4.3 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out for the Li||Li cells cycled three times at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 and a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm−2 using a VSP potentiostat. The frequency range was 300 kHz to 500 mHz, the AC amplitude was 10 mV, and the DC bias voltage was 0 V. 2.3 Characterization For high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; S-4800, Hitachi) and XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Scientific) measurements, Li and Cu electrodes were collected from Li||Li and Li||Cu cells cycled 30 and 10 times at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm−2, rinsed with DME to remove residual electrolyte, and dried for 24 h in a glove box. The ionic conductivity and viscosity of the electrolytes were measured at various temperatures using an ionic conductivity meter (MCS 10, Biologic) and a viscometer (A&D), respectively. Prior to each measurement, the electrolytes were maintained for at least 30 min at the required temperature. Pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) spectroscopy measurements (AVANCE III 400, Bruker; operated at 400.13 MHz) were performed to determine self-diffusion coefficients (D). For these measurements, the electrolytes were injected into a coaxial NMR microtube. A DC polarization (electrochemical) method [37] was used to determine the Li-ion transference number (t + EC). A small AC impedance signal with an amplitude of 5 mV was measured from 300 kHz to 500 mHz before and after DC polarization, and a potential of 15 mV was applied for 300 s using a VSP potentiostat (BioLogic). Raman spectra (Nicolet Almeca XR, Thermo Scientific) of the electrolytes were collected with a resolution of 0.5 cm−1 using the 780 nm line of an Ar ion laser as the excitation source at room temperature. DSC (Discovery DSC, TA Instruments) measurements were conducted at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The Cu substrates were collected from Li||Cu cells in an Ar-filled glove box after 20 cycles at 60 °C with a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 and a Li deposition capacity of 0.5 mAh cm−2.", "output": {}}

However, issues such as the insulating nature of sulfur, polysulfide shuttling, huge volume change, and tardy polysulfide intermediate conversion cause rapid capacity decay, severe self-discharging, and drastic drop in coulombic efficiency, and impede the commercialization of LSBs. Many working steps of LSBs suffer from the problem of “dead sulfur”, which can no longer be cycled for various reasons. How to suppress “dead sulfur” and improve the reaction kinetics has been a major research interest in recent years. Among numerous studies that aim to solve these problems, the search for more efficient catalytic materials that facilitate polysulfide intermediate conversion and chemically anchor soluble lithium polysulfides has drawn increasing attention. This review focuses on the design and mechanistic interpretation of various advanced catalytic materials for the activation of “dead sulfur” in LSBs.", "output": {}}

The original powders of Ti6Al4V with a particle size of 20–53 μm were provided by Bright Laser Technology Co., Ltd. Ti6Al4V substrates were cut into 10 mm × 15 mm × 5 mm speics and grounded with SiC papers of up to a grit size of 2000, subsequently cleaned within an ultrasonic bath for 10 min before further treatments. Species with different types of surface texture, including Cylinder (shorted as C), Diamond (shorted as D), and Sin (sinusoidal curve, shorted as S), were designed by Solidworks 2016 Software, as shown in Fig. 1 . The size of high spots is 400 μm, as shown in Fig. 1(a1-c1). The height is 150 μm (Fig. 1a2-c2). The texture density has been set as 65%, and the size of the texture is controlled by the software before printed, the maximum is 0.33 mm, and the minimum is 0.285 mm. 2.2 Anodic oxidation The substrates were set as the anode of the DC power, whose cathode was a graphite electrode. The anodic oxidation reaction was carried out in the electrolyte (90% ethylene glycol, 10% H2O, 0.5 wt% NH4F) with magnetic stirring at a certain voltage. 40 V for 1 h was used to produce TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) coatings on Cylinder (shorted as C-TNTs), Diamond (D-TNTs) and Sin (S-TNTs) textures. After the anodic oxidation process, the samples were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h. 2.3 Silver antibacterial composite coatings Before spray deposition of Ag, the species were molecularly grafted with two silanes of 6-(3-triethoxysilylpropylamino) -1,3,5-triazine-2,4-azide (pTES, Sulfur Chemical Institute, Japan) and (3-Mercaptopropyl) triethoxysilane (MPTES, Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd.), according to the procedure described previously [34]. The TNTs-coated Ti6Al4V specimens were firstly dipped into the pTES solution (0.1 mol/L, ethyl alcohol solution) and dried in the air, followed by ultralight radiation (254 nm, 0.1 J/cm2). After that, the samples were immersed into MPTES solution (2 mmol/L, stilled water solution) for crosslinking reaction for 10 min. After that, Tollen's reagent (0.1 mol/L AgNO3 and 50 ml/L 25% NH3·H2O) and reducing agents (0.1 mol/L C6H12O6) were sprayed onto the TNTs of Ti6Al4V substrate surfaces by using simple spraying bottles [35], whose diameter of the spray nozzles (made of polymer) is 500 μm. 2.4 Surface morphology and compositions The surface morphology was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, ZEISS ULTRA 55) with an X-act Electron Microprobe for EDS. X-ray diffraction (XRD Rigaku UItima IV) was used to study crystal structure with a Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. An optical contact angle meter (OCA35, Dataphysics) was used to measure water contact angle (CA) by measuring five different positions per value using droplet shape analysis. The contact angle is measured using the sessile drop image at the intersection (three-phase contact point) between the droplet profile and the surface projection (baseline). The volume of the droplet is 5 μL, and the measured contact angle is the static contact angle. 2.5 Antibacterial assay The antibacterial activity of the composite coatings on Ti6Al4V alloy was evaluated by the bacterial counting method using Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) according to ASTM G21–96. E. coli was cultured in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth or LB agar plates, and S. aureus was cultured in tryptic soy broth or agar (TSA) plates. Samples were placed in a wells plate where 0.3 mL bacterial suspension (1.0 × 105 cfu/mL) was dropped into each well. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the samples were washed three times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to remove the weakly attached bacteria. Then 2.5% glutaraldehyde (diluted in PBS) was applied to keep the bacteria immobilized and intact. Bacteria were freeze-dried and sputter-coated with platinum before observation using FE-SEM.

The biggest difference from general mineralization is the participation of biological macromolecular organisms, cells, and organic substrates. The samples were placed into a centrifuge tube containing 15 ml Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) solution (The contents are listed in Table 1 ) and kept in a 37 °C water bath without light for 7 days. The SBF solution was renewed every two days. After that, the samples were cleaned with deionized water and then dried with a 70 °C oven.

The MC3T3-E1 cells were digested with 2 mL 0.25% trypsin containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). When the cell density approached 90% confluence, it was then subcultured at a 1:3 ratio. Once the cell density approached 90% confluence again, the MC3T3-E1 cells were digested with 2 mL 0.25% trypsin containing EDTA, and the suspension was then diluted to 1 × 105 cells/mL. 2.7.2 Proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cell The proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells was assessed with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Jiangsu KeyGEN BioTECH Corp., Ltd., China) following the manufacturer's suggestions. Cells were seeded at an initial density of 1 × 105 cells/mL in 12-well plates in an incubator with 5%CO2 at 37 °C for 1, 3, and 7 days.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Controlled synthesis of iron series MOFs and its composite nanomaterials 2.1 Controlled synthesis of Fe-MOFs Iron group materials have many advantages, which make them widely used in many fields. Iron is one of the metals with the most abundant capacity in the crust. Iron group materials have the advantages of easy access and low cost, making them an economical choice for MOF. At the same time, iron group materials are easy to process and shape, and the required shape and size can be obtained through various processing methods. In addition, it also has adjustable catalytic performance. The electronic configuration of iron ion can be changed by adjusting the oxidation state and coordination environment, thus adjusting the catalytic performance of MOF materials. This adjustability makes iron-based MOFs have potential application value in catalytic reactions. Iron and other transition metal elements can exhibit controllable magnetic behavior in MOFs, which is of great significance for fields such as magnetic materials, data storage, and sensors. Lately, more and more research reports on iron-based MOFs have been published, showcasing the excellent future and development prospects of iron-based MOFs. The following figure shows the electronic configuration structure of iron group and their applications in MOF materials. Simultaneously, it visualizes the number of research papers published in recent years ( Fig. 1). MOFs also have different structures and dimensions. MOFs under different dimensions have different properties and can be applied in various environments. The following figure shows the visualization process model of MOFs transforming into different dimensions ( Fig. 2). Iron based MOFs come in various forms, including one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional. At the same time, the chemical properties of different forms of MOF also vary. Here we present several visualization models of common iron-based MOFs ( Fig. 3). Fe-MOFs, an iron-based MOF variant, have garnered significant attention owing to their intriguing structural features, exceptional resilience, longevity, and efficacy. Fe-MOFs are poised to emerge as the optimal choice among MOF materials for potential real-world applications [16]. The current review investigates the controlled synthesis of Fe-MOFs, alongside recent research findings concerning their composition and diverse applications. A comprehensive overview is provided on various synthetic approaches for Fe-MOFs, encompassing hydrothermal and diffusion methodologies, xerogel conversion, as well as the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma method. Emphasis is placed on their potential utility in catalysis and gas storage. The selection of these methods will directly influence the structural characteristics and properties of MOF, including its crystal morphology, pore structure, and surface functionalization. Consequently, this decision determines the potential applications in catalysis and gas storage while further augmenting its practical value.The primary aim of this research is to offer a perspective on investigating advancements in the field of the controlled synthesis of Fe-MOFs to enhance the practical applications further. The logical design and preparation of porous carbon materials and bimetallic oxide nanomaterials have had an outstanding influence regarding the progress made over past few years, and there has been significant advancement in advancements made towards efficient electrode materials for storage applications. It is tough, but not impossible, to construct carbon fibers vertically and uniformly on the nanoscale surface of porous polymetallic nanomaterials. Scientists propose a self-templated based MOF bimetallic oxide/nano porous carbon nanostructure (Ni-Fe-O/NPC) synthesis and assembly strategy on porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) [17], The vertical arrangement of Ni-Fe-O/NPC on PCNFs is conducive to rapid redox reactions by reducing the ion/electrode diffusion distance at the electrode-electrolyte interface, and contributes to improve the overall electrochemical behavior. As an independent electrode of supercapacitors, it exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance of 1419 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and demonstrates excellent cycling stability. After 10,000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate is about 88.5%. The Ni-Fe-O/NPC@PCNFs-400//Fe2O3/NPC@PCNFs asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) boasts a significant energy density of 41.3 Wh kg−1 at an impressive power density of 892.2 W kg−1, demonstrating an enduring service life of 20,000 cycles and an impressive rate capability of 78.6%, suggesting their promising applications. By meticulously designing and preparing porous carbon materials and bimetallic oxide nanomaterials, the controlled synthesis of iron-seires MOFs can be achieved, enabling precise control over their formation. This synthesis and assembly strategy effectively enhances the application performance of MOFs in supercapacitor electrode materials by improving specific capacitance, cycle stability, and service life. These advancements demonstrate significant improvements in energy density, power density, and cycle life, thereby promoting the progress of supercapacitor technology. Hydrothermal is one of the methods to prepare Fe-MOFs. Here, researchers use 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NH2-BDC) as ligand through a simple hydrothermal route to synthesize bimetallic Ni/Fe MOFs [18]. After calcination, the spindle-like nickel and iron based organic framework are conveyed to porous NiFe2O4 nanorods. The resultant Ni-Fe2O4 based sensor displays a splendid sensitivity (nearly 60–500 ppm), wonderful selectivity for different volatile organic compounds and a strong linearity and durability of toluene detection under wide concentration. NiFe2O4 has three fundamental elements of perfect catalytic activity, sufficient specific surface area and porous morphology, mainly owed to its superior gas detection capabilities. The results show that NiFe2O4 derived from bimetallic Ni/Fe MOFs has broad application prospects in toluene gas sensors. Besides, the latest research report introduces the preparation of new nanoscale Fe-MOFs/Eu MOFs heterostructures for the first time [19]. Spherical Fe-MOFs which have a vast surface area were incorporated as the matrix for dispersion growth of rod-like Eu-MOFs. The prepared Fe-MOFs/Eu-MOFs materials show superb magnetic resonance/optical imaging capabilities. In the plasma-enhanced synthesis strategy of iron-based MOFs with enhanced adsorption capacity, Fe-MOFs were prepared using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma technique, and their effectiveness in adsorbing methyl orange was evaluated. The resulting Fe-MOFs were examined through XRD, SEM, FT-IR, BET, and ZETA potential analyses. Considering the ability of Fe-MOFs for adsorption, this synthesis environment was systematically studied. The best conditions were determined as follows: the discharge time is 80 minutes [20]; Voltage during discharge was 18 kV; The concentration of reactants was 10 mg mL−1; The ratio of the mass of terephthalic acid to the mass of ferric chloride hexahydrate is 1:1. The Fe-MOFs synthesized under the optimal conditions showed an adsorption capacity of 750 mg g−1 at a level of 100 mg L−1 methyl orange and a dose of 0.1 g L−1 Fe-MOFs. The kinetic adsorption data exhibited a suitable fit by using the pseudo second order kinetic equation., while the isothermal data were effectively modeled using the Langmuir equation. Plasma generation and setup has been proved to be an excellent method for synthetizing MOFs. The above figure shows the controllable synthesis pathways and characterization images of the morphology of some common iron-based MOFs. The synthesis method of ultra-thin Ni Fe MOF nanosheets and the visualization pathway of their application in oxygen evolution reactions are shown above( Fig. 4a). At the same time, TEM images and EDX element mapping of Ni Fe MOF nanosheets were also displayed (Fig. 4b). MOF derived double shell Co3O4@Co-Fe Oxides, single shell Co Fe oxides, and Co3O4 nanocages are also important MOF derived materials, and their synthesis pathways are shown in the schematic diagram(Fig. 4c), as well as SEM images of ZIF-67 (Fig. 4d). NPC/RGO composite materials are the latest developed MOF derivatives, and the schematic diagram of their manufacturing process (Fig. 4e) and TEM images of ZIF-67 have reference significance (Fig. 4f) Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation is widely employed in MOF studies for predicting material structure, band structure, electronic structure, and catalytic activity, thereby providing theoretical guidance for experimental design. By simply stirring a mixture of Fe/Co salt and 1,4-phthalic acid (1,4-BDC) in a reactive solution containing triethylamine and water, researchers developed a facile synthesis method for the successful preparation of a 2D bimetallic MOF with an Fe/Co ratio of 1:2 [24]. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations elucidate that both the unique 2D morphology and Fe/Co co-doping contribute to the superior OER performance observed in this system. Furthermore, DFT calculations demonstrate that introducing Fe into the Co-based 2D MOF can modulate Co's electronic state and reduce free energy associated with rate-determining step during OER, thereby promoting catalytic activity. The Hofmann MOFs provide a versatile platform for investigating the interplay between different metal elements and their impact on OER activity. Among all MOFs, the Fe/Co mixed Hofmann MOF (CoFe-PYZ) demonstrates the lowest overpotential under alkaline conditions (pH=13), with a value of 300 mV at 10 mA cm−2 [25]. XPS and DFT calculations reveal that this exceptional performance can primarily be attributed to the synergistic effect resulting from Co2+ and Fe2+ ions. Furthermore, DFT calculations demonstrate that the bimetallic synergy between Co/Fe effectively modifies the electronic environment of Fe2+, thereby reducing the energy barrier associated with OER reaction and promoting its overall activity. In summary, CoFe-PYZ exhibits superior OER activity due to the synergistic interplay between Co2+ and Fe2+ ions, which facilitates an alteration in the electronic environment of Fe2+, ultimately enhancing its catalytic performance. The highly promising Fe/N/P co-doped carbon nanotubes (P-FE-N-cnts) were successfully synthesized via a facile one-step pyrolysis process. By utilizing NaH2PO2 as both a phosphorus source and reducing agent in conjunction with MIL-100(Fe) and ZIF-8 precursors, extended P-FE-N-cnts with an impressive specific surface area were obtained [26]. These materials exhibit exceptional electrocatalytic properties in zinc-air batteries, surpassing those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. DFT calculations elucidated the mechanism of ORR and the modulation of properties of P-Fe-N-CNTs. The introduction of phosphorus enhances the adsorption strength of OOH and OH intermediates while weakening O* adsorption, thereby improving ORR performance by regulating the structure surrounding the catalytic site through electron transfer. Appropriate phosphorus doping increases ORR activity; however, excessive doping reduces catalyst stability and leads to higher overpotential values. This study provides a controllable method for synthesizing extended P-Fe-N-CNTs with excellent properties that are particularly suitable for applications such as zinc-air batteries. 2.2 Controlled synthesis of Co-MOFs The coordination polymers know as Co-MOFs exhibit a porous crystal structure resulting from the coupling of cobalt metal ions and organic ligands. This article offers an overview of various Co-MOF materials and their recent advancements while providing an in-depth account of the preparation techniques utilized for these compounds. Over the past few decades, multiple synthetic approaches have been developed to fabricate MOFs such as mechanical synthesis, solvothermal synthesis, and electrochemical synthesis. Based on the previous studies, a rapid rotating hydrothermal crystallization method was proposed to synthesize Co-MOF, which greatly accelerated the Co-MOF crystallization process. When the rotational speed reaches 150 rpm, it takes only 2 hours of crystallization time to prepare Co-MOF-150–2 which has strong structural integrity and stability [27]. The optimal Co-MOF-150–2 showed significant efficient catalytic performance and excellent specificity in the conversion of pinene into epoxide using mild reaction settings. Co-MOF-150–2 catalyst exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and discrimination in the epoxidizing process of a-pinene under mild reaction environment. Transformation of a-pinene achieved an impressive 99.5%, with a remarkable 95.7% yield of 2,3-epoxypinane. Notably, the Co-MOF material prepared using the rotation method also demonstrated good stability and efficient catalytic performance during recovery experiments. Although the rapid rotating hydrothermal crystallization method significantly reduces the synthesis time, the design of nanostructured materials for excellent and efficient dual functional electrocatalysts has received widespread attention. The rapid hydrothermal crystallization method, coupled with high rotation speed, can significantly reduce the synthesis time and enhance the preparation efficiency of Co-MOFs. Consequently, the synthesized Co-MOF-150–2 exhibits exceptional structural integrity and stability, thereby holding immense significance for its subsequent applications. Nevertheless, finding fast and effective synthesis strategies are still a challenge. Based on the latest research findings, we have reviewed a fast and scalable Ni/Co/Co3O4@C Nanorod synthesis method to achieve outstanding overall water decomposition [28]. Scientists first prepare fancy nickel within a few minutes Ni-MOF@Co-MOF through using microwave synthesis. After that, we used laser marking to mark the MOF@MOF to transformed it into hybrid Ni/Co/Co3O4 nanoparticles covered with graphite carbon in a few seconds. At the amount of current per unit area of 30 mA cm−2, the overpotentials of the OER and HER of the bimetallic catalyst are 246 mV and 143 mV respectively. The electrolytic cell assembled with bimetallic catalysts provides a high current density of 20 mA cm−2 under a voltage of 1.6 V and shows good resilience (even after 24 hours of operation at a voltage of 1.52 V, the retention rate is close to 91.6%). By employing a combination of microwave synthesis and laser labeling technology, the rapid preparation of Ni-MOF@Co-MOF is achieved, resulting in the formation of mixed Ni/Co/Co3O4 nanoparticles within minutes. This method not only enables the efficient production of polymetallic mixed nanocatalysts but also facilitates the development of intricate layered structures, thereby enhancing their catalytic performance. According to the latest research findings, the Co and Ni-containing and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid as joints bimetallic MOF prepared via an aqueous synthesis approach was rapidly achieved high output under microwave irradiation. The catalytic effect of synthetic MOF on the formation of cyclic compounds carbonate from carbon dioxide and epoxides was investigated. The Ni-Co-MOF enables the epoxide to have a selectivity over 99% under solvent-free conditions, and has a high conversion rate from epoxide to cyclic carbonate [29]. Catalytic exhibition of the bimetallic framework (Ni-Co-MOF) surpasses that of both the individual single metal MOF catalysts (Ni-MOF and Co-MOF) and their mechanical combination (Ni-MOF + Co-MOF). This suggests the presence of a collaborative catalytic effect resulting from the transport of electrical charge between the Ni and Co metal centers, which has a high advantage in the catalytic conversion of CO2. The catalytic capabilities of Ni-Co-MOF can also be extended to both terminal and cyclic epoxides, and at least six cycles of recoverability studies have been conducted. Finally, a reasonable reaction mechanism of epoxide CO2 cycloaddition catalyzed by Ni-Co-MOF is proposed. In the figure below, we have summarized the controllable synthesis pathways of two latest Co based MOFs materials. Among them, we demonstrated the three-dimensional pathway of the synthesis process of CoP/Co MOF ( Fig. 5a) and the mapping image of CoP/Co MOF (Fig. 5b). Additionally, Co3O4@Co-MOF as an important Co based MOF, the one-step hydrothermal synthesis of composite materials is an important synthesis pathway. We have demonstrated its synthesis pathway (Fig. 5c) and Co3O4@Co-MOF SEM photos (Fig. 5d).Similarly, microwave-assisted synthesis methods and controlled microwave-assisted reverse micelle synthesis routes have been employed to prepare efficient Co-MOFs. The products were studied by SEM images, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results suggested that the products have uniform morphology, small particle size distribution, high thermal stability, and large specific surface area [32]. Comparing other MOF samples, the characteristics and composition of the product are significant and remarkable. In the synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives, the newly synthesized nanostructures could be used as recyclable catalysts. After confirming the relevant structures, the antioxidant activities of the derivatives were evaluated based on DPPH method, and the relationship between antioxidant activities antioxidant activities and structures was examined. Except recoverability, the catalytic activity of Co-MOF has a significant effect on the preparation of 1,4 dihydropyridine derivatives. Incorporating a secondary metal ion into monometallic MOFs is a successful strategy for markedly enhancing their electrochemical performance. Hang and her group have successfully synthesized a sequence of Co-Ni bimetallic MOFs (Co/Ni-MOFs) by substituting Co2+ ions into a Ni-MOF framework (Ni3(OH)2(tdc)2(H2O)4n, H2tdc = 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid). Among these bimetallic MOFs, Co/Ni-MOF-2:1, with an optimal Co/Ni ratio, exhibits enhanced specific conductance, endogenous reactivity, and durability. Remarkably, in comparison to monometallic Ni-MOF, nanowire morphology of the Co/Ni-MOF-2:1 enhanced specific capacitance, reaching a value of 610 F g−1 when operating with a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Co/Ni-MOF-2:1 with its nanowire morphology shows excellent rate performance, retaining 88% of its capacitance under an elevated current density of 5 A g−1. and enhanced cycling performance (72% retention after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, when Co/Ni-MOF-2:1 is combined with activated carbon to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, it displays an elevated specific capacitance (228 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and good cycling stability (95.5% of capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1) [33]. These findings highlight the Co/Ni-MOF-2:1 demonstrates significant potential in electrochemical energy storage applications. The Mn/Co oxide catalysts with a hexagonal layered structure were synthesized using precursors derived from the MOF of Mn/Co, exhibiting various physical and chemical properties depending on the ratio of Mn to Co. Among these catalysts, the sample denoted as Mn/CoOx-3/2, characterized by a wide spacing between layers, demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity in total oxidation of propane with a T90 value of 270 °C at a rate of 120 L g−1 h−1 [34]. The formation energies of oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 and Co3O4-Mn were calculated using DFT to be 1.44 eV and 1.17 eV, respectively. This observation suggests that manganese doping enhances the propensity for oxygen vacancy formation, which is consistent with experimental findings obtained from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, these oxygen vacancies facilitate the activation of adsorbed oxygen species and promote the activation of propane molecules on Co3O4-Mn. By employing DFT calculations and electrochemical analysis, we have successfully demonstrated the correlation between the electron density of the Co active site and its performance in the ORR. Through DFT calculations, researchers designed and synthesized a Co monatomic catalyst with an optimized Co1-N3PS active group, referred to as Co1-N3PS/HC. This catalyst exhibits exceptional ORR activity in alkaline media, surpassing both Pt/C and most non-precious metal ORR catalysts, displaying a half-wave potential of 0.920 V along with superior ORR kinetics [35]. The study provides valuable atomic-level insights into the relationship between electron density at the active site and catalytic properties, thereby facilitating rational design strategies for efficient catalysts. Experimental validation combined with DFT calculations confirms that Co1-N3PS/HC possesses an optimized electron density alongside a unique structure featuring single-atom Co active centers contributing to its outstanding ORR performance. The table below shows the theoretical specific capacity of iron-series MOFs applied to different capacitors, demonstrating the application advantages of iron-series MOFs and their composite nanomaterials ( Table 1). 2.3 Controlled synthesis of Ni-MOFs In recent years, MOFs have garnered considerable attention due to their distinctive structure and potential for diverse applications. Among these, nickel (Ni)-based MOFs have demonstrated promising prospects in electrochemical sensing owing to their low detection limit, high sensitivity, and reliable stability. Nevertheless, the limited conductivity exhibited by pristine Ni-based MOFs poses a constraint on their electrochemical applications. To overcome this limitation and enhance their performance in electrochemical sensing, it is imperative to augment the properties and electrical conductivity of unadulterated Ni-MOFs. In this regard, various synthesis methods have been employed to fabricate nickel-based MOFs with controlled architectures and configurations. By modifying the synthesis process, researchers can improve the conductivity and fine-tune the properties of Ni-based MOFs for electrochemical sensing applications. This comprehensive review provides an extensive examination of different synthesis techniques used for preparing Ni-based MOFs while also elucidating the arrangements and forms of synthesized pure or modified MOFs. The aim of this work is to contribute to the future research and development of Ni-based MOFs in the rapidly growing domain of electrochemical sensing. For the first time, a honeycomb multistage spherical structured Zn-doped Ni-MOF material is successfully synthesized using a microwave-assisted approach, with HCl serving as the modulator. By changing the concentration of Zn ions mixed, an ideal electrode material of Zn-doped Ni-MOF with optimized properties, which has excellent electrochemical characteristics: at 1 A g−1 and 20 Ag−1, the specific capacities are 237.4 mA h g−1 and 122.3 mA h g−1, respectively, is obtained [53]. It is among the greatest MOF performances documented thus far. Good electrochemical characteristics is attributed to the special the arrangement of crystals and distinct shape of Zn-doped Ni-MOF materials. The honeycomb multistage spherical structure significantly amplifies the specific surface area and electrochemical performance, consequently promoting enhanced exposure of active sites and improved charge transport. These results substantiate that microwave-assisted synthesis offers a swift and effective strategy for fabricating electrode materials tailored to Ni-MOF supercapacitors. In addition to microwave-assisted synthesis, hydrothermal synthesis is also a common synthetic strategy. Ni-MOF derived NiO/Ni nanoparticles integrated into r-GO were accomplished prepared using a hydrothermal technique, subsequently accompanied by high-temperature calcination (400 ℃ under an Ar atmosphere) using varying mass ratios of Co and Ni-MOF (0.1:1, 0.5:1, 1:1). The effect of GO addition at different mass ratios can improve the electrochemical properties of Ni-MOF derived NiO/Ni electrode materials. The mass ratio is (1:0.5) with the greatest specific capacity (649.22 C g−1 at 3 A g−1) and maintains 81.1% of the starting capacity measurement at 20 Ampere g−1 after 5000 cycles [54]. The assembly of asymmetric supercapacitors, which are known as ASCs, using nickel MOF derived NiO/Ni/r-GO composite materials and rGO as anodes and cathodes exhibits excellent electrochemical performance too. The maximum value has an energy content of 39.59 W h kg−1, and peak power output of 4.136 kW kg−1, and 85% capacity preservation. The results validate that the hydrothermal synthesis method, incorporating GO at varying mass ratios, significantly enhances the electrochemical performance. This enhancement is manifested through exceptional energy density, peak power output, and capacity retention. Consequently, this characteristic renders it highly suitable for asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs), thereby affirming its potential application in the realm of energy storage. There are many consensuses on the synthesis pathways of Ni based MOFs, and here we review the latest graphical synthesis pathways of Ni based MOFs. The synthesis process diagram of egg yolk shells in the table below Ni@C@ZnO microspheres were synthesized using ethylene alcohol and pyrolysis methods ( Fig. 6 a). Simultaneously displaying TEM images of YS-Ni@C@ZnO composites. (Fig. 6 b-c). In DFT calculations, the presence of Ni3+ substantially enhance the binding of H* on NiO, providing a comprehensive explanation for the exceptional HER electrocatalytic activity observed in Ni/NiO-400. The enhanced performance can be visually understood by referring to the schematic representation depicted below (Fig. 6d). We also presented HAADFSTEM images (Fig. 6e) and SEM images of Ni/NiO-400 (Fig. 6f). We illustrate the sequential production procedure of porous NiCo2S4 derived from MOF on electrochemically activated flexible carbon cloth (ACC) (Fig. 6g). As demonstrated, the elemental mapping images of Ni-Co-S/ACC-160 reveal the existence of Ni, Co, and S (Fig. 6h). According to latest research, Ni-MOF-74 has been demonstrated as a synergistic method for ammonia production with RF plasma in the presence of catalyst. Compared with pure nickel metal, Ni-MOF showed increased ammonia generation. Specifically speaking, the ammonia yield was up to 0.23 g-NH3 (g-catalyst kWh)−1, and the energy expenditure is 265 MJ mol−1 [58]. The enhancement of catalytic activity of Ni-MOF amidst plasma was because of the existence of pores. It promoted the transport of mass in guest molecules and product molecules in the reaction process, the existence of enhance the availability of minimize surface hydrogen recombination and Ni metal sites. In addition, the ammonia energy output of our plasma nickel MOF catalyst is better than that of the most advanced RF plasma catalytic system. A straightforward synthesis method was employed by Cheng to prepare Ni metal-organic phosphate (Ni-MOPh) (C6H5O3NiP•H2O), resulting in the formation of a 3D blossom-like superstructure comprising stratified nanosheets [59]. By subjecting Ni-MOPh to air calcination at 600 °C, researchers successfully synthesized an unstructured derivative of Ni-MOPh, denoted as [A-(Ni-MOPh)-D], which maintained the original hierarchical 3D macroscopic organization of the precursor and displayed uniform pore distribution. The amorphous nature of [A-(Ni-MOPh)-D] contributes to its low lattice energy, facilitating efficient redox reactions or ion intercalation/de-intercalation. Furthermore, the presence of Ni (II) in A-(Ni-MOPh)-D with increased electron affinity enhances its propensity for redox reactions. The properties make A-(Ni-MOPh)-D an appropriate choice of supercapacitor electrode material. Extensive electrochemical testing revealed that A-(Ni-MOPh)-D exhibited excellent function not exclusively limited to in traditional three-electrode systems, and in devices operating in water-based environments, where activated carbon was utilized as the counter electrode. The utilization of rare earth elements and Ni-MOF demonstrates enhanced electrochemical properties in comparison to conventional Ni-based MOF. La-NMF-0.1, synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method using La-doped Ni-MOF, exhibits a larger specific surface area, enhanced charge transfer rate, superior electronic conductivity, and outperforms Ni-MOF in terms of electrochemical performance. DFT calculations reveal the significant impact of La-NMF-0.1's electronic structure, with La doping increasing electron density near the ferrometer level in the conduction band (CB) [60]. Both La-NMF and Ni-MOF exhibit semi-metallic characteristics according to TDOS analysis; however, La-NMF displays a higher intensity peak in the CB region. The involvement of the La-4 f orbital in band formation improves charge transfer and electron conductivity in La-NMF-0.1, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. Incorporation of Dy atoms into Ni-based MOF nanoneedles grown on carbon cloth significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity. DFT calculations were utilized to investigate the impact of Dy doping on oxygen reduction reaction in this modified MOF system. Structural reconstruction was considered, and models of Dy2O3/NiOOH and NiOOH were established for DFT calculation and analysis. The results demonstrate that Dy2O3/NiOOH exhibits a rich state density and higher D-band center value, thereby enhancing the adsorption capacity of oxygen-containing intermediates [61].

Therefore, effective capture of radioactive iodine is essential for developing and using nuclear energy to solve the energy crisis. Some materials that have been developed for removing radioactive iodine still suffer from complex synthesis, low removal capacity, and non-reusability. Herein, covalent organic framework (COF)/chitosan (CS) aerogels were prepared using vacuum freeze-drying, and the COF nanoparticles were tightly attached on the green biomass material CS networks. Due to the synergistic effect of both COF and CS, the composite aerogel shows a three-dimensional porous and stable structure in the recycle usage. The COF/CS aerogel exhibits excellent iodine adsorption capacity of 2211.58 mg g−1 and 5.62 g g−1 for static iodine solution and iodine vapor, respectively, better than some common adsorbents. Furthermore, COF/CS aerogel demonstrated good recyclability performance with 87 % of the initial adsorption capacity after 5 cycles. In addition, the interaction between iodine and imine groups, amino groups, and benzene rings of aerogel are the possible adsorption mechanisms.

The problems of dendrite growth and volume expansion caused by Li metal cycling can be suppressed by the introduction of a 3D conductive skeleton. However, as the cycle progresses, the Li metal deposits on the upper surface of the skeleton structure, making the host ineffective. Herein, a 3D porous host is designed comprising ZnO nanoparticles having lithiophilic gradients assemble on an interconnected 3D carbon nanotube/graphene skeleton. The 3D porous carbon nanotube/graphene structure exhibits excellent conductivity and a large specific surface area, which reduces the local current density and provides ample space for Li deposition. More importantly, the lithiophilic gradient ZnO nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets enable hierarchical induction of Li-ion nucleation and guide Li deposition into the host, preventing preferential deposition at the top surface of the host even during prolonged Li stripping/plating. The host delivers a high Coulombic efficiency of up to 98.2% for at least 500 cycles, and the symmetrical cell comprising the host operates smoothly for >920 h (<20 mV).

In this regard, mixture of SbCl3 (0.25 g) and GQDs (30 mL of 0.045 M) was prepared under stirring for 10 min. Afterward, we added 30 mL of glycol to above solution. Then the prepared solution, 0.2 g of sulfur powder and 0.3 g of NaBH4 introduced into an autoclave and kept in oven at 180 °C for 72 h. In the end, the resulting products washed with distilled water and ethanol three times. 2.2 Synthesis of GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 composite TO prepare GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 composite, 2 mL Tetraethyl Orthotitanate (TEOT) was dissolved in 5 mL ethanol. Then the above solution was injected drop wise into the solution of 0.2 mL acetic acid and Sb2S3/GQDs composite under ultrasonic waves with 60 W/cm2 intensity and 18 kHz frequency for 2. The obtained products were dried at 40 °C for 48 h. 2.3 Device fabrication First, FTO sheets were rinsed by aid of mixture of a detergent solution, followed by washing with ethanol and acetone for 30 min. TiO2 paste was deposited on cleaned FTO by doctor-blading to devise photoanode. As prepared photo anodes were immersed into dye solution and reserved at 48 °C for 24. Counter electrode made by coating platinum on FTO glass. Sb2S3, TiO2/GQDs, Sb2S3/GQDs, and Sb2S3/GQDs/TiO2 (S-G-T) devices were manufactured by dropped their suspensions on photoanode. In the second part, we used procedure reported in our previous work with some modification to fabricate devices with S-G-T sensitizer [5]. In the case of modified cell including GQDs as a down conversion material, the GQDs solution dropped on the piece of mirror and dried in oven. Then it was stuck on the top of cell by using glue. In the bottom of cell, mirror (2) with an aperture was used to reflex those photons comes from the mirror (1). 2.4 Computational details In this Calculations we used a GQDs consisting of a 25 carbon atoms graphene core, terminated by hydrogen and functionalized by carboxylic acid group, hydroxyl group and amine group. Also the calculations were done for 2 × 2 supercell of the TiO2 (1 0 1) surface orientation including 64 oxygen and 32 titanium atoms, and the lattice constant is equal to a = b = 3.77 Å and c = 9.48 Å. In addition we use an antimony sulfide molecule containing 2 antimony and 3 sulfides. The vacuum depth was up to 20 Å for three models. All geometry optimizations and electronic properties were performed using DFT method in DMol3 package [35,36]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the exchange correlation functional Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was picked out [37]. For dispersive intermolecular interactions and long-range van der Walls forces, the DFT-D method within the Grimme scheme is used in all the calculations [38]. We applied the double numerical basis plus polarization (DNP) basis set [39], which has been widely used in the fields of physics and materials science [37,39]. The optimization of the all structures were carryed out by using Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of 7 × 7 × 1. The energy tolerance accuracy, maximum force, displacement and global orbital cut-off radius were selected as 10−5 Ha, 2 × 10−3 Ha Å−1, 5 × 10−3 Å, and 5.0 Å, respectively. To better understand the mechanism of charge transfer, we used the Mulliken charge analysis method. The strength of interactions can be characterized by the binding energy, defined as follows: (1) E b = E complex - E adsorbate + E adsorbent , In this definition, Eadsorbate and Eadsorbent are the total energy of adsorbate (GQD or Sb2S3) and adsorbent (TiO2), respectively.

Typically, 5 g of melamine was heated at 580 °C in a muffle furnace for 2 h, with a ramp-up rate of 7 °C/min. This procedure aimed to establish the foundational graphitic carbon nitride structure.\nSynthesis of g-C3N4-TiO2 photocatalysts\nThe TiO2 solution was prepared in deionized water, and bulk g-C3N4 was added to it (6% of TiO2 (0.06 g) in 1 g of g-C3N4). The resulting mixture underwent sonication for 1 h, followed by stirring at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave for 12 h at 180 °C, following the hydrothermal process [11]. Centrifugation and filtration were employed, and wash the residue with deionized water and ethanol after it was subjected to calcination about 450 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace.\nSynthesis of Ni-decorated g-C3N4-TiO2 photocatalysts\n0.5 g of a synthesized g-C3N4-TiO2 sample was taken and mixed in 100 ml of deionized water. Different amounts (1, 3, and 5 mg) of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2.6H2O) were added to the above solution (0.034, 0.010, and 0.17 M solution, respectively) and kept for stirring for 2 h, followed by an increase in temperature to 70–80 °C. A solution of 1 molar sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added for metal reduction. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, centrifuged, washed with ethanol, and calcined at 400 °C for 1 h.\nCharacterizations\nThe samples, as synthesized, underwent comprehensive characterization utilizing a range of analytical techniques. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were acquired through the utilization of the PerkinElmer Spectrum apparatus, covering the spectral range from 4000 to 400 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. For this analysis, the samples were compressed into KBr pellets. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were acquired employing a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffraction instrument. To explore the morphology, particle size, and surface characteristics of the synthesized Ni-decorated g-C3N4-TiO2, a scanning electron microscope from Philips Co. (XL30) was employed. Additionally, UV–Vis absorption spectra were generated through the use of an Agilent Cary 60 UV–Vis spectrophotometer.\nPhotocatalytic activity\nThe photocatalytic activity of the synthesized Ni-decorated g-C3N4-TiO2 photocatalysts was evaluated through degradation tests using target pollutant dyes. Characterization technique of the UV–Vis spectroscopy was employed to analyze the samples performance. The sample underwent scanning across the range of 400 to 800 nm, revealing the max absorbance for MB at 664 nm, as shown in Fig. 1.\nMethod enactment for degradation\nThe stock solution’s initial meant dye concentration was 30 ppm. For each reaction (20 ml dye solution), 10 mg of the photocatalyst was optimally dispersed. After that, the dye solution was shaken for 30 min in complete darkness to create an equilibrium between adsorption/desorption [1]. A 420-nm UV cutoff lens on a 300-W xenon lamp was used in this study as a UV source. With a pH of 7.0 for the dye solution, the dyes degraded most effectively in 120 min at a temperature of 25 °C. Within an aqueous medium, the catalyst generated OH radicals, which were activated by UV light exposure [30]. This process led to the production of CO2 and minerals as secondary products. Before UV analysis, all samples underwent centrifugation [11].\nInfluence of irradiation time\nIt was thoroughly investigated how irradiation time affected the degradation of MB. Exposing the dye solutions required a 300-W xenon lamp with a 420-nm cutoff UV lens for different exposure intervals ranging from 20 to 120 min, with a 20-min break between each exposure. After being exposed to radiation, all samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 to 30 min. UV analysis was used to determine the percentage deterioration.\nDye dose study\nImpact of varying dye concentrations was examined using diverse ppm solutions of dyes. The 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ppm were meticulously prepared from the available stock dye solution. To follow the same method used in the time study. Subsequent to an optimized time frame of 120 min. Subsequently, to calculate the percent deterioration, UV analysis was conducted.\nCatalyst dosage effect\nThe impact of catalyst dosage on dye degradation was inspected by altering the quantities of catalyst used; specifically, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg of catalyst were suspended in 20 ml dye solution for 120 min (optimal time). A similar method was repeated in it. The percent degradation employed UV–Vis spectroscopy to measure.\nEffects of pH study\nDifferent solutions with pH values of 2, 4, 7, 10, and 14 were produced to evaluate the effects of pH on dye deterioration. Subsequently, these solutions were gently stirred in darkness for 30 min and then subjected to irradiation using a UV lamp. A 300-W xenon lamp with a UV cutoff filter adjusted to 420 nm was used as the UV lamp.

Hence, several approaches have been proposed to eliminate/reduce the levels of HMs before the discharge/reuse of HMs-contaminated waters.

Therefore, the key aim of this article is to review the progress in the development and application of different classes of conventional and emerging adsorbents for the abatement of HMs from contaminated waters. Adsorbents that are based on activated carbon, natural materials, microbial, clay minerals, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), nano-zerovalent iron (nZVI), graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are critically reviewed, with more emphasis on the last four adsorbents and their nanocomposites since they have the potential to significantly boost the HMs removal efficiency from contaminated waters. Furthermore, the optimal process conditions to achieve efficient performance are discussed. Additionally, adsorption isotherm, kinetics, thermodynamics, mechanisms, and effects of varying adsorption process parameters have been introduced. Moreover, heavy metal removal driven by other processes such as oxidation, reduction, and precipitation that might concurrently occur in parallel with adsorption have been reviewed. The application of adsorption for the treatment of real wastewater has been also reviewed. Finally, challenges, limitations and potential areas for improvements in the adsorptive removal of HMs from contaminated waters are identified and discussed. Thus, this article serves as a comprehensive reference for the recent developments in the field of adsorptive removal of heavy metals from wastewater.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental procedure 2.1 Material details The base matrix material in this work was AZ91D Mg alloy supplied by M/s. Exclusive Magnesium (Hyderabad). Table 1 gives the composition of AZ91D. Nanopowder ZnO, MnO, and TiO2 with a particle size of < 100 nm, ≤ 50 nm, and < 100 nm has been used as reinforcement materials. Table 2 lists the basic properties of the base matrix and reinforcements. 2.2 Fabrication of AZ91D/oxide nanocomposites The nanocomposites were casted using a semi-automated stir-squeeze casting setup with ultrasonication and the provision of a gas-protected environment supplied by M/s.SwamEquip. A protective gas atmosphere was created by mixing argon and sulphur hexafluoride in a 9:1 ratio to prevent Mg from reacting with the environment. One kilogram of AZ91D alloy, cut into billets, was initially placed in the cylindrical furnace. The furnace was kept at 800 °C to make it completely liquid. Simultaneously, 1 wt% oxide reinforcement was preheated for one hour at 300 oC to remove moisture and increase wettability. A vibration-assisted preheater kept at 300 °C was deployed to feed reinforcement particles into the matrix. A schematic procedure of the production of nanocomposites is illustrated in Fig. 1. At 800 °C, the molten metals were stirred at 400 rpm using a titanium stirrer, to amalgamate the matrix and reinforcement. To prevent material from sticking to the blade, it was coated with graphite. After adequate stirring, a titanium ultrasonic probe was placed into the slurry and a digital UST controller was used to sustain vibration at a power of 2500 W for 5 min with a frequency of 20 kHz. Finally, the melt was transferred to a preheated (300 °C) steel die to solidify for 120 s at 150 MPa squeeze pressure. The fabricated materials were then subjected through a T6 heat treatment process in a muffle furnace following ASTM B661–06 standard [20]. To keep the muffle furnace free from oxidation, a constant supply of 90% of argon gas was used. The specimens were first heated to 415 oC at 1.5 oC/min for 16 h, then it was quenched in water, at room temperature. The quenching of each material was carried out at a water temperature of 25 ± 1 oC. Then after, the samples were aged artificially for 16 h at 168 °C. Finally, the specimen was allowed to cool in the open air to reach ambient temperature, and the AZ91D alloy and nanocomposites were heat treated using the same approach. AZ91D alloy, AZ91D/ZnO, AZ91D/MnO, and AZ91D/TiO2 are designated as AZD, AZO, AMO, and ATO, respectively, for ease of reference. 2.3 Microstructural analysis An Optical Microscope (OM) (Olympus-BX51M) and High Resolution-Scanning Electron Microscope (HR-SEM) (FEI-quanta FEG 200 F) were used to study the materials microstructural characteristics. A cylindrical specimen size of 10 × 10 × 5 mm was fixed in Bakelite mold using a hot mould press. In a double-disc polishing machine, the prepared samples were polished with SiC sandpapers (120, 220, 600, 800, 1200, 1600, and 2000 grades). To attain an ultra-fine surface finish, 1 µm diamond paste was used. According to the ASTM E407 standard, polished samples were etched with picral reagent (100 ml of ethanol and 2–4 g of picric acid) until a brown colour film appeared on the surface [38]. The average grain size from the OM image was also measured using the linear intercept technique in accordance with the ASTM E112–96 standard. [22]. XRD pattern was used to investigate the crystalline phases present in the nanocomposites. The wavelength and scan speed used for the XRD test was λ = 1.5000 Å and 2° min-1 respectively. 2.4 Mechanical properties The mechanical characteristics of the produced materials were examined using tensile and hardness tests. A Vickers microhardness tester (Make: Leitz Wetzlar) was used to determine the hardness of the fabricated alloy and nanocomposites according to the ASTM E384–16 standard [39]. A 500 g- force indentation load was applied over 15 s of dwell time. The hardness test was performed multiple times for every material, and the average was taken. The hardness of the materials was determined by first indenting a specimen in the middle, followed by indenting it 20 mm out from the centre in each of the four perpendicular directions. A universal tensile machine (Make: FMI, India) with a strain rate of 1 mm/min and a load of 1 kN was employed to conduct the tensile test following the ASTM-E8M-03 standard [22]. For each material, three replications were conducted, and the average value was taken. 2.5 Tribocorrosion tests According to ASTM G119–09 standard, a tribocorrosion test was conducted using a linear reciprocating tribometer (Ducom, India) equipped with a corrosion setup (IVIUM, India)[40]. Initially, the samples for the Tribocorrosion test were polished with grit papers to maintain a surface roughness of < 0.25 µm which was measured by using a surface roughness tester (Made: Mitutoyo SJ 210). The surface roughness test was carried out three times in each sample and the average value was taken. Then the specimens have been placed in an anticorrosion cell with various concentrations of NaCl electrolyte (2–3.5%). In order to get respective NaCl concentrations of 2%, 2.5%, 3%, and 3.5%, 20 g/l, 25 g/l, 30 g/l, and 35 g/l of NaCl were added. Graphite was employed as the counter electrode, saturated calomel electrode (0.241 V) was used as the reference electrode (RE), and test samples were used as the working electrode. As a counter material, EN8 (ϕ6 ×12 mm) was placed vertically on the exposed sample region. The pin was loaded and reciprocated using a transducer at a length of reciprocating stroke 10 mm, frequency 3 Hz, an applied load 20 N, and a sliding time of 600 s. Prior to, during, and after the experiment, the OCP was assessed. Tafel Plot was carried out at ± 0.5 V potential difference and a 2 mv/s scanning rate. By using the Tafel curve, Icorr , Ecorr values, and rate of corrosion were evaluated from IVIUM software using the Tafel exploration technique. Then the corrosion tendency was analysed through cyclic polarization. Fig. 2.

Here, we propose a mode of selective wrapping deposition of Li mediated by in-situ planted CuGa2 seeds on liquid metal painted Cu collector.

Asymmetric Li/CuGa2@Cu cells enable a long-term cycling over 220 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of ~99% at 3 mA cm−2, a low voltage hysteresis (~100 mV at 5 mA cm−2), and high endurability on current density up to 10 mA cm−2 and areal capacity up to 5 mAh cm−2. The alloying of rich Ga with Cu collector is responsible for the low nucleation barrier and the tight bonding of CuGa2 seeds with substrate enables the high endurance of Li deposition cycling. The ductile liquid metal can be directly dropped on Li foil to form uniform LixGa alloying layer. With the self-migration of gallium on Li surface, symmetric Ga@Li cells can cycle for 1000 h and full cells can maintain a highly reversible capacity of 110 mAh g −1 for high-load LiFePO4 cathode (12 mg cm−2).

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Tetrabutyl titanate (TBT), hydrofluoric acid (HF, ≥ 40.0 %, AR), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, AR), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR), agar (BR) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., ltd. (Shanghai, China). Sodium chloride (NaCl, AR), peptone (BR) was purchased from Rhawn. Yeast extract (YE) was purchased from Sangon Biotech. 2.2 Fabrication of 2D/2D TiO2/Bi2O3 composite Firstly, TiO2 nanosheets and Bi2O3 nanosheets were fabricated. For synthesis of TiO2 nanosheets, 2 mL of HF was added drop by drop to a beaker with 10 mL of tetrabutyl titanate and then stirred for 20 min. Right afterwards, the liquid was diverted to an autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 24 h. Then the obtain precipitates were properly washed and dried to obtain TiO2 nanosheets. For synthesis of Bi2O3 nanosheets, sodium hydroxide (2.4 g) was dissolved in 60 mL of DI water, then 9.7 g of Bi(NO3)3 was added in the sodium hydroxide solution. Subsequently, the precursor mixture was treated by a hydrothermal method at 180 °C for 18 h, and then the powders were collected, washed, and dried. Then, the powder samples were further calcined in air at 200 °C for 30 mins, and then heat to 400 °C for 30 mins, and then increased to 700 °C for 3 h. For the 2D/2D TiO2/Bi2O3 composite (as illustrated in Scheme 1 ), 100 mg TiO2 and different amounts of Bi2O3 were separated in 60 mL H2O and then stirred for 1 h, after that the suspension was moved to a hydrothermal vessel and treated at 100 °C for 12 h. The suspension was collected, washed, and dried to obtain the TiO2/Bi2O3 composites with different mass fractions of Bi2O3 to TiO2, the corresponding samples were named as TB-3 (3 wt%), TB-5 (5 wt%), TB-7 (7 wt%), TB-9 (9 wt%), TB-11 (11 wt%) and TB-13 (13 wt%). A control sample with the same composition of TB-9 was prepared without hydrothermal process. 2.3 Antibacterial experiment 2.3.1 Preliminary preparations Medium preparation: Liquid Luria-Bertani (LB) broth: 5 g tryptone, 2.5 g yeast extract, 5 g sodium chloride were dissolved in 50 mL ultrapure water in a glass bottle. Solid LB broth: 5 g tryptone, 2.5 g yeast extract, 5 g sodium chloride, 7.5 g agar powder were dissolved in 500 mL ultrapure water in an Erlenmeyer flask. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) medium: 4 g NaCl, 0.1 g KCl, 0.13 g KH2PO4, 0.71 g Na2HPO4 were dissolved with 400 mL deionized water, and then concentrated hydrochloric acid was used to adjust the pH to 7.4. Sterilization of culture medium and laboratory supplies: Test tubes, petri dishes, centrifuge tubes, pipette tips, liquid and solid LB culture medium, and PBS buffer were put into an autoclave and sterilized at a high pressure of 0.1 MPa and a high temperature of 121 ℃ for 20 min, and then left in the oven. 2.3.2 Preparation of the tested bacterial solution The strains stored in the environment of −80 °C and 15 % glycerol were taken out and inoculated into 4 mL liquid LB medium test tubes under aseptic conditions, and the test tubes were placed in the medium in incubator with a 37 °C constant temperature overnight. Then, using a pipette to transfer 1 mL of bacterial solution to a centrifuge tube. After centrifugation at 4000 rmp for 5 min, the bacterial pellet was obtained, and the supernatant was removed. Then the suspended bacteria were diluted with PBS buffer, and an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical density absorption value (OD600) at the growth of 600 nm. The OD600 value of the bacterial solution was 0.8–1.0 and it can be used without bacteria. Currently, the number of tested bacteria in the bacterial liquid was about 0.8–1.06. 2.3.3 MIC test MIC is the lowest drug concentration that can inhibit the growth of bacteria in the medium after culturing bacteria in vitro for 18–24 h. MIC can be used to estimate the antibacterial performance. First, different volumes of catalysts solution were combined with liquid LB medium containing bacterial liquid. Mixed solution was incubated with a constant temperature shaker at 37 °C for 24 h and the growth of the bacteria was recorded, so that the concentration of the material that can inhibit the bacteria can be roughly determined. Next, a formal test was performed according to this concentration. The catalysts solution was added to the sterilized test tube and mixed with 200 μL of the bacterial solution, and using liquid LB medium to make up the volume of the mixed solution to 4 mL, so that the concentration of the catalysts in the formed solution is within the preset value. Another 200 μL pure bacterial solution was mixed with 3.8 mL liquid LB medium as a set of control experiments. After the solution was mixed uniformly, it was placed in a constant temperature shaker at 37 °C and incubated. Every 1 h, 100 μL of the mixed solution was pipetted from the test tube to measure the change in OD600. According to the obtained data, a bacteriostasis curve can be draw to determine the MIC value. 2.3.4 MBC test MBC is the minimum drug concentration that is required to kill 99.9 % of bacteria. First, the test bacteria solution was transferred to liquid LB medium for growing the bacteria to the exponential growth phase. The bacteria were removed and centrifuged to obtain the bacterial pellet. The supernatant was removed and then diluted with PBS buffer to an OD600 value of 0.02. Different volumes of the catalyst solution were mixed with the diluted bacteria solution, and another group of bacteria solution without the composite material was used as a control. Then, the mixed bacterial solution was cultured in a constant temperature shaker at 25 °C for 3 h, 1 μL of the mixed solution was taken out, diluted 103 times with 999 μL of PBS buffer, and then 100 μL of the diluted solution was dropped into the solid LB medium with a pipette. After coating the quartz beads on the agar plate evenly, and then the plate was placed upside down to incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. After the cultivation was completed, the plate was taken out to observe the growth of the colony in the solid LB medium to determine the MBC. 2.3.5 Photocatalytic antibacterial experiment Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia (E. coli), was used as the target in the photocatalytic antibacterial experiment. Typically, catalysts were added into the diluted bacterial solution and then irradiated with 300 W Xenon lamp (42.86 mw/cm2) without filter in a water bath shaker at 25 °C for 6 h. 1 μL solution was taken out from mother liquor every 1 h and then diluted and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. The colony-forming units (CFU) were counted to establish minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The details can be seen in Supporting Information. 2.3.6 Preparation and sterilization test of antibacterial glass The TB-9 sample was dispersed in H2O with a concentration of 300 ppm, and the solution was spin-coated on the glass sheet and dried in the oven. Then, 40 μL of E. coli with OD600 value of 1 was dropped onto the above glass sheet, and then the glass sheet was put under 300 W Xenon lamp (42.86 mw/cm2) for 6 h. The MBC test as described above was carried out over the prepared glass. 2.4 H2 generation experiment 25 mg of the samples was dispersed in a three-necked flask having 8 mL of triethanolamine and 72 mL of H2O solution. No cocatalyst was added in this reaction system. A LED lamp (365 nm, 75.52 mw/cm2) was utilized to illuminate the reactor. The generated H2 is extracted from the reactor and then measured with a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). 2.5 Characterization The powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2550 diffractometer), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI ESCA-5000C) and in-situ irradiated XPS (Thermofisher escalab 250xi) with a 300 W Xe lamp were used to characterize the structure and surface element.

Furthermore, we investigated their performance in photodegrading 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,5-DHN) into 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione (Juglone). Integrating metalloporphyrin-based ligands into bimetallic MOFs represents a pioneering advancement in this field. Photocatalytic reactions were conducted using various stoichiometric ratios of Co and Zn as metal nodes, along with meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP-H2) and Mn(III) meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin chloride (Mn-TCPP) as linkers. Results revealed that Co as a node led to the formation of nanorod metal–organic frameworks (MOF) structures, while Zn enhanced photocatalytic activity. Significantly, a photodegradation yield of 72% was achieved with a 1:3 molar ratio of Co to Zn in Zn75%/Co25 (TCPP-Mn), demonstrating a synergistic interplay between Co to Zn nodes and Mn-porphyrin linkers. Characterization was performed using structural and microscopic methods. Additionally, various parameters were optimized to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanism, revealing the promising potential of MM-MOFs for efficient photodegradation of 1,5-DHN and beyond. It is noteworthy that the integration of metalloporphyrin-based structures into MM-MOFs for photodegradation processes is relatively uncommon, underscoring the novelty and potential significance of incorporating porphyrin-based ligands in mixed metal MOFs for photodegradation applications.\nGraphical Abstract", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Zn75%/Co25 (TCPP-Mn)", "application": "photodegrading 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,5-DHN) into 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione (Juglone)", "props": {"photodegradation yield": "72% @ 1:3 Co:Zn molar ratio"}}}}

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were investigated with a Nicolet iS10 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). 2.2 Preparation of fluorescent COF The fluorescent COF can be synthesized by employing ETBC and TAT as reactants. In brief, a mixture of 0.5 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 0.5 mL of n-butanol, and 0.14 mL of acetic acid (6 M) was prepared in a 10 mL Pyrex tube with TAT (0.06 mM) and ETBC (0.045 mM) added to it. The tube was sonicated for 15 min followed by three freeze-pump-thaw cycles for degassing purposes. Subsequently, the mixture was sealed and heated at 120 °C for 5 days in an oven, resulting in the production of a yellow precipitate. The precipitate was rinsed thrice with acetone, THF, and methanol before finally obtaining the as-synthesized COFs through vacuum drying at 50 °C overnight. 2.3 Detection of TYR activity For TYR activity detection, 100 μL of tyrosine (10 mM) solution, 600 μL of PBS (50 mM, pH 7.0), 100 μL of COF (2 mg/mL), and 100 μL of TYR solutions with varying activities (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 U/L) were added to a 2.0 mL centrifuge tube.

Cellulose dialysis membrane (MWCO = 1 kDa) was purchased from Spectrum Labs. Conductive carbon paper (0.3 mm thickness, areal resistance < 3 mΩ cm−2) was bought from VECK Store, China. The carbon paper was activated by an electrochemical method in 2 M H2SO4 solution using an Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively, and a constant voltage 2.2 V was applied for 20 min. After activation, the carbon paper was annealed in air at 200 ⁰C for 3 h. Deionized water was used in all experiments. 2.2 Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles and CDs TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized via the microwave technique whereas CDs were synthesized from sodium polyacrylate via the pyrolysis method as reported in our previous work [24]. Firstly, titanium isopropoxide (14.21 g) and hydrazine hydrate (10.02 g) were combined in DI water with constant stirring for 20 min. After that, the mixedsolution was microwaved at 100 W for 35 min in a microwave oven. The colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles were then filtered out, washed multiple times with ethanol and DIwater, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 4 h, yielding white powder TiO2 nanoparticles. Secondly, sodium polyacrylate (5 g) was dissolved in1.25 M nitric acid solution (70 mL) in a porcelain crucible and pyrolyzed for 6 hat 250 °C in a furnace. After that, the reaction mixture was combined withDI water and filtered through filter paper. The filtrate was neutralized with a 10 M NaOH solution before being centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 rpm.

PVDF and carbon black were fixed at 5:15% w/w for all electrodes. Pure 1 M H2SO4 solutions were used as electrolytes for optimizing the amount of CDs added to the TiO2 electrode. Furthermore, 1 M, 2 M, and 3 M H2SO4 were used to explore the suitable concentration of electrolytes. After that, the best condition of the electrode was used to study the impacts of the CDs in the H2SO4 electrolyte. For the preparation of the CDs-added electrolytes, 2 M H2SO4 solution (70 mL) was mixed with three different amounts of CDs (0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 g) and they were labeled as 0.5-CDH, 1-CDH, and 2-CDH (CDs-added H 2SO4), respectively. 2.4 Characterization and electrochemical measurement Contact angles were measured using a tensiometer (100 Theta Lite, Biolin Scientific) and 1 µL solution droplets.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Some crystal planes of metal compound nanocrystals play an important role in the anchoring and transformation of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs), which effectively improves the shuttle effect and electrochemical reaction kinetics of LiPSs. While, as a new generation of secondary batteries with great potential, the commercial applications of Li-S batteries are limited by rapid capacity decay due to the shuttle effect of LiPSs and large volume change of sulfur. Herein, nano-Fe3C@N,P dual-doped porous carbon microspheres (Fe3C@NPC) were designed as cathode hosts of Li-S batteries. Fe3C@NPC composite materials were prepared by upcycling mental from electroplating sludge via microalgae. The adsorption transformation of microalgae enables Fe3C nanocrystals of 10–30 nm to be evenly embedded in the N and P dual-doped carbon materials, which makes the crystal planes (220) of Fe3C nanocrystals more involved in the reaction, thus improving the coulomb efficiency and long cycle stability of Li-S battery. Besides, the hierarchically porous spherical structure with high specific surface area not only effectively adapts to the change of sulfur volume during the charging/discharging process, but also significantly increases the electrolyte contact area and shortens the Li ion transport distance. Therefore, Fe3C@NPC, as the multifunctional hosts of sulfur for Li-S batteries, realizes high catalytic activity and strong chemical binding with LiPSs, providing a high reversible coulomb efficiency (> 99%) and a high reversible capacity of 575 mAh g−1 at 1 C after 500 cycles, with low-capacity decay rates of 0.056% per cycle.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "nano-Fe3C@N,P dual-doped porous carbon microspheres (Fe3C@NPC)", "application": "cathode hosts for Li-S batteries", "props": {"coulomb_efficiency": "> 99%", "reversible_capacity": "575 mAh g-1 @ 1 C after 500 cycles", "capacity_decay_rate": "0.056% per cycle"}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental 2.1 Materials FTO-coated conducting substrates (15 Ω/square) were purchased from Xop Glass (Spain). The transparent mesoporous TiO2 paste (20 nm-sized anatase particles, 18 NR-T) and scattering paste (150–200 nm-sized nanoparticles, WER2-O) were bought from Dyesol. The redox couple electrolyte consists of iodide and tri-iodide (I-/I3 -), and Ruthenium-based N719 dye were bought from Solaronix. Dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol, acetone, ethanol, isopropanol (IPA) solvents, TiCl4 and graphene nanoribbons (GNR of 2–15 μm and 40–250 nm length and width, respectively) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. FLG platelets powder was supplied by Raymor Inc. All the chemicals are used as received without any further purification. 2.2 GNR-TiO2 hybrid and FLG-TiO2 film deposition GNR suspension was prepared in DMF. DMF is an aprotic solvent, which has a better exfoliation ability. FLG suspension was dispersed in ethanol. A compact TiO2 blocking layer was deposited on FTO glass substrates by dip-coating the substrate into an aqueous solution of TiCl4 (0.5 mM) for 30 min at 70 °C. Then the photoanodes were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min under ambient atmosphere and left to cool down to room temperature. Then double transparent mesoporous layers were prepared by tape casting the hybrid GNR-TiO2 and FLG-TiO2 paste containing optimum concentrations of 0.005 wt% GNR and 0.01 wt% FLG suspension in 20 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles paste, respectively. As prepared layer was dried for 15 min under ambient conditions and then on a hot place at 120 °C for 6 min. Finally, the scattering layer of 150–200 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles paste was deposited over the transparent layers of hybrid paste following the same approach. Then, all photoanodes were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min under an ambient atmosphere with a heating rate of 6 °C/min. The film thickness was controlled through the number of layers of GNR-TiO2 cast and measured by profilometry. As prepared mesoporous anodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Dye sensitization was performed by dipping the TiO2, FLG-TiO2 and GNR-TiO2 mesoporous anodes into an ethanolic solution of N719 dye (0.5 mM) for 24 h in a sealed beaker at room temperature. All photoanodes were washed carefully with ethanol to remove the unabsorbed dye molecules. The active area of the fabricated DSSCs was in the range of 0.20–0.25 cm2. The final percentage of carbonaceous material in the TiO2 photoanode was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis of TiO2 paste. After annealing at 500 °C for 30 min, we found that the TiO2 paste lost 80% of its original weight before sintering [23]. The estimated average concentration of GNR and FLG per volume of TiO2 active layer is 0.94 × 10-4 ml and 1.88 × 10-4 ml, respectively. 2.3 Device fabrication and characterization DSSCs were fabricated by using the dye-sensitized hybrid FLG-TiO2 and GNR-TiO2 photoanodes and a Pt/PtOx-sputtered FTO (Pt film thickness: 5 nm) counter electrode with a 60 μm thick plastic spacer between them. The redox couple iodide/triiodide (I3 -/I-) liquid electrolyte was used hole transport medium. The current–voltage (I-V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter and an ABET2000 solar simulator under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm2), calibrated using a reference silicon solar cell. The stability tests in this study were performed with continuous one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm2), over the different periods at room temperature. The light source with one sun intensity (100 mW/cm2) without any additional UV filtration. The PV parameters of the cells were measured at various light exposure times. Only samples with a stable liquid electrolyte content and counter electrode without degradation were maintained to monitor the evolution of overall performance. Dye loading measurements of bare TiO2 and TiO2 with FLG and GNR hybrid photoanodes were performed using a UV–Vis-NIR spectrometer. Dye molecules were removed from the dye-sensitized anodes by rinsing with 0.1 M NaOH. Absorption spectra of the removed dye molecules solutions were recorded with Cary 5000 UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian) having a scan speed of 600 nm/min. One cubic centimeter volume of quartz cuvettes was used in the measurement. The wavelength-dependent incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was performed using the Oriel IQE200 certified system which is equipped with a 250 W QTH lamp as a monochromatic light source covering the 300–1800 nm spectral range with a spectral resolution of 10 nm. The IPCE measurements were recorded in AC mode in which the device is illuminated with a monochromatic light source in addition to one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm2) and calculated according to the following equation: IPCE (%) = (1240*J)/(λ*I) × 100 where J is the photocurrent density (mA/cm2), λ is the wavelength of the incident light (nm), and I is the intensity of the incident light (mW/cm2). The photocurrent density of DSSCs can be estimated from the IPCE spectra of corresponding DSSCs by integrating the incident photon flux density Iphoton ( λ ) and IPCE ( λ ) over the entire wavelength range of the incident light using the following equation: J = q e ∫ λ min λ max I photon λ I P C E λ d λ Where J is the photocurrent density, λ is wavelength of the incident light, and q e is the electron charge. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out under dark by using a GAMRY 1260 A Impedance/Gain-Phase Analyzer with an applied AC signal of 50 mV in amplitude range (0 V and 100 mV) above the open-circuit voltage of the solar cells, in the frequency range between 10 mHz and 300 kHz.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "GNR-TiO2", "Syns_method": "tape casting", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "GNR", "amount": "0.005 wt%"}, "prc2": {"name": "TiCl4", "amount": "0.5 mM"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "aqueous solution"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dip-coat", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "ambient", "time": "15 min"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "6 min"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "FLG-TiO2", "Syns_method": "tape casting", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "FLG", "amount": "0.01 wt%"}, "prc2": {"name": "TiCl4", "amount": "0.5 mM"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "aqueous solution"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dip-coat", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "ambient", "time": "15 min"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "6 min"}}}}}}}

NiSO4·6H2O and MnSO4·H2O were stoichiometrically dissolved into deionized water to obtain a 2 M solution (TM). NaOH was dissolved to obtain a 4 M solution (OH). The TM and OH were then pumped into a 2 M Na2SO4 solution with 3 mL ammonium hydroxide as a complexing agent under an N2 atmosphere at a rate of 1 mL min−1. The resultant was filtered and washed with water, and then dried at 80 °C overnight to obtain the precursor. The precursor was mixed with Li2CO3 with a molar ration of 1:1.25 and calcined at 500 °C for 6 h and 900 °C for 12 h in the air to obtain Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2. 2.1.2 Preparation of LMNO@LMO and intermediates 2.4 g acetic acid was dropped into 20 mL saturated nickel acetate solvent to produce an acidic solvent (AS) whose pH value was 6. Then, 1 g as-prepared LMNO was added into AS and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was then filtered and washed with water to remove the acid and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The dried powder was labeled as LMNO-AS. The LMNO-AS was then calcinated at 300 °C for 3 h to obtain LMNO-V which was further calcinated at 700 °C for 3 h to obtain LMNO@LMO in the air. Besides, another LMNO material was stirred in AS for 10 h and calcinated at 300 and 700 °C for 3 h in the air to obtain LMNO@LMO-10 for structural analysis. 2.2 Physical characterizations The crystal structure of the samples was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rint-2000, Rigaku, Cu Kα). The morphology of the particles was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI QUANTA 250) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Titan, G2 60-300). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer, PHI 5600) was used to determine the surface compositions. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF, Tsushima, XRF-1800) was used to detect the elemental compositions. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, ARCOS) was used to detect the elemental compositions. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC, DSC 200PC) was used to analyze the heat reaction in the calcination process. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR, Bruker EMXplus X-ban) was employed to analyze the oxygen defects. 2.3 Electrochemical performance tests The mixture of prepared cathode materials, acetylene black, and binder (polyvinylidene fluoride) were dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone with a mass ratio of 80: 15: 5 to make a cathode slurry that was cast onto an aluminum foil, followed by being dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain the electrode. The mass loading on the electrode was around 2.2 mg cm−2. The electrodes were cut into round disks with a diameter of 12 mm. Then the CR-2032 coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, employing the prepared electrode as cathode, lithium foil as the counter electrode, porous polypropylene film (Calgard 2400) as a separator, and 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in the mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (v:v = 1:1) as the electrolyte. The ratio of electrolyte to active materials was around 40 μL mg−1. Galvanostatic tests were performed on Neware battery testers (Neware Co. Ltd., Shenzhen) within the voltage range from 2.0 to 4.8 V, and the current of 1C was set as 250 mA g−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested within a frequency range of 10000～0.1 Hz under a voltage amplitude of 10 mV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed by a CHI660E electrochemical analyzer (Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd., Shanghai) with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage range from 2.0 to 4.8 V.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2", "Syns_method": "coprecipitation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Li2CO3", "amount": "1.25 mol per precursor mole"}, "prc2": {"name": "NiSO4·6H2O", "amount": "0.2 mol"}, "prc3": {"name": "MnSO4·H2O", "amount": "0.6 mol"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "6 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "900 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "LMNO@LMO", "Syns_method": "calcination", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "LMNO", "amount": "1 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "CH3COOH", "amount": "2.4 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "nickel acetate solution", "amount": "20 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "300 °C", "time": "3 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "700 °C", "time": "3 h"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "LMNO@LMO-10", "Syns_method": "calcination", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "LMNO", "amount": "1 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "CH3COOH", "amount": "2.4 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "nickel acetate solution", "amount": "20 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "300 °C", "time": "3 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "700 °C", "time": "3 h"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Bleached kraft eucalyptus pulp was refined in a PFI mill (Mark VI No. 621, Norway) to the beating degree of 75° SR. Cellulase (Trichoderma reesei, enzyme activity: 10,000 U/mL) and xylanase (Trichoderma reesei, enzyme activity, 20,000 U/mL) were purchased from Ningxia Sunson Biotechnology Co., Ltd, nano TiO2 colloid was supplied by Taitang Nano Technology Co. 2.2 Preparation of CNC CNC was prepared by the enzymatic hydrolysis method [19] as follows: (1) Preprocessing: 44 g eucalyptus pulp fiber (11% solid content) and 200 mL of 50% (V/V) glycerin solution were added to a beaker. Then, the mixture continued to be stirred at 200 r/min and 38 °C for 4 h. (2) Compound enzyme hydrolysis process: Mixed the pretreated pulp fibers with the complex enzyme solution (10 U/mL, xylanase: cellulase = 1:9) and added 400 mL of deionized water. The mixture was shaken in a shaker at 50 °C for 12 h at a speed of 200 r/min. Then the prepared CNC samples were washed three times and centrifuged at 1000 rpm/min after each wash. 2.3 Fabrication of TiO2/CNC sensor Firstly, 200 mL CNC was mixed with TiO2 colloid in beakers at different mass ratios of TiO2: CNC = 3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, and 15%. The mixture was stirred in a water bath at 30 °C for 30 min. Secondly, TiO2/CNC suspension was sonicated for 1 h to complete the composite process. Finally, TiO2/CNC sensor was prepared by vacuum-assisted filtration, and gold was sprayed on the surface of the TiO2/CNC composite film with an ion sputtering machine after drying. The characterization and mechanical analysis of TiO2/CNC composite films were performed as the descriptions in S1 and S2 of supporting information (SI). 2.4 Humidity sensing measurements The TiO2/CNC composite film was cut into a rectangular shape of 7 mm in length, 5 mm in width, and 0.07 mm in thickness for all electrical tests. The schematic diagram of the humidity test is displayed in Fig. 1 , and the response of the sensor is measured by a WS-30A sensor test system (Weisen, China). The different relative humidities were obtained by saturated salt solutions of LiCl (11% RH), CH3COOK (23% RH), MgCl2 (33% RH), MgNO3 (54% RH), NaCl (75% RH), KCl (85% RH) and KNO3 (95%) in air-tight vessels, respectively [20]. To measure the response of the TiO2/CNC humidity sensor, the stable baseline was first achieved by putting the sensor into the bottle of LiCl (11% RH). And then, the sensor was quickly put into the bottle with the target humidity. After the measurement was obtained, the humidity sensor was moved back to the bottle of LiCl (11% RH) for the stable baseline, preparing for the subsequent measuring operation. The sensor response (S) is calculated according to Equation (1). (1) S = R 0 R RH where R 0 is the resistance of the sample at 11% RH, R RH is the resistance upon exposure to the target RH condition. The response time and recovery time of sensor are defined as the time required for the change in the response value to reach 90% of the equilibrium value and to decrease to 10% of its maximum response, respectively. After having investigated the humidity sensing performance, the TiO2/CNC composite film was applied as humidity sensor to respiratory monitoring and skin moisture monitoring, respectively. The experimental details are supplied in S4 of SI. 2.5 Computational methods All the calculations in this work were performed in Materials Studio 7.0. We first built the CNC model on the basis of Ali et al.’ work [17], and then created a vacuum slab with 15.0 Å of thickness to avoid the interactions between the adjacent layers. The layered CNC model was optimized using the Forcite module with the convergence tolerance of energy, force, and displacement set as 1 × 10−4 kcal/mol, 5 × 10−3 kcal/mol/Å and 5 × 10−5 Å, respectively, under 5000 maximum iterations. The Van der Waals interactions between atoms was simulated using a Universal Force Field (UFF), while the electrostatic interactions were described using partial charges calculated with QEq method and summed with the Ewald method. After the optimized CNC model was obtained, we loaded the cluster of TiO2 into the vacuum space of the CNC and ran the aforementioned optimization process again to create the optimal TiO2/CNC model. To study water interaction with TiO2/CNC, different numbers of water molecules were loaded into TiO2/CNC using the Sorption module, in which the Metropolis Monte Carlo method was applied with the exchange, conformer, rotate, translate and regrow trials. 1 × 105 MC steps were used for equilibration and 1 × 106 steps were for production. The description of Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions was identical with the optimization process in the Forcite module. After water loading, the H-bonding was then calculated under a threshold of the hydrogen-acceptor distance of 2.5 Å and donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle of 90.0°.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "CNC", "Syns_method": "enzymatic hydrolysis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "bleached kraft eucalyptus pulp", "amount": "44 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C3H8O3", "amount": "200 mL (50%)"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "400 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"temperature": "38 °C", "time": "4 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "enzyme hydrolysis", "parameters": {"temperature": "50 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash_and_centrifuge", "parameters": {"rpm": "1000 rpm/min", "cycles": "3 times"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "TiO2/CNC", "Syns_method": "vacuum-assisted filtration", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "CNC", "amount": "200 mL"}, "prc2": {"name": "TiO2 colloid", "amount": "3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, 15% (mass ratio)"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"temperature": "30 °C", "time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "sonicate", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "vacuum_assisted_filtration"}, "post_proc4": {"step": "spray_gold"}}}}}}

During the initial batch-mode operating period of Stage A, the medium was supplemented with 1 g L−1 yeast extract. Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C (ATCC 204508) was pre-grown in YPD medium (per liter: 10 g yeast extract; 20 g peptone; and 20 g glucose) from frozen stocks. For flask experiments, YN medium, which does not contain yeast extract (Experimental procedures, ESI†), was supplemented up to a concentration of 150 mM acetate (YNA).\nFor flask experiments with gas-fermentation effluent, the effluent from a previous gas-fermentation study with C. ljungdahlii and 2xP7 medium without yeast extract similar to Richter et al.13 was collected, and used after filter sterilization. For the initial batch-mode operating period of the Stage-B bioreactor (Stage B), 500 mL of filter-sterilized effluent from Stage A was combined with 500 mL of 2-fold concentrated YN (2xYN) medium. During the continuous-mode operating period, Stage B was fed with filtered effluent from Stage A and an additional 2-fold or 4-fold concentrated YN (2x or 4xYN) medium (Experimental procedures, ESI†). Thus, yeast extract was not applied to the flasks experiments and the continuous-mode bioprocessing experiments.\nA two-stage bioprocessing system was used to grow C. ljungdahlii in Stage A and S. cerevisiae in Stage B (Fig. 1). A 2 L Biostat M chemostat (Braun, Allentown, PA) with a 1 L working volume was used as Stage A at 35 °C and a pH of 5.7, while stirring at 300 rpm (Experimental procedures, ESI†). Stage A was inoculated with a glycerol stock that previously had been prepared from a C. ljungdahlii-rich broth, which was collected during a gas-fermentation study similar to Richter et al.13 The gas-flow rate (H2 : CO2, 80 : 20 vol%; Airgas East, Ithaca, NY) was adjusted from 50 up to 120 mL min−1 to not be limiting when the gas consumption increased. Stage A was equipped with a Na2S feed and a 100% cell guard (cell-retention filter system) to retain bacterial cells and to filter the effluent (Experimental procedures, ESI†). In continuous-operating mode, a liquid-flow rate of 40 mL h−1 was applied (0.04 h−1 dilution rate).\nA 1.5 L Celligen cell-culture unit (New Brunswick, Edison, NJ) with a working volume of 1 L was used as Stage B at 30 °C and a pH of 5.4, while stirring at 200 rpm (Experimental procedures, ESI†). Stage B was inoculated to an OD600 of 0.05 with a pre-culture of S. cerevisiae grown in YNA with a 100 mM acetate concentration. In continuous-operating mode when a flow-rate of 40 mL h−1 was used, 20 mL h−1 from Stage A was combined with 20 mL h−1 from a 2xYN-bypass feed. When a flow-rate of 60 or 80 mL h−1 was used, 40 mL h−1 from Stage A was combined with 20 or 40 mL h−1 from a 4xYN bypass feed, respectively. Thus, the dilution rate for Stage B varied between 0.04 and 0.08 h−1. Oxygen was sparged at an 88.5 ± 19.6 mL min−1 (n = 60) air-flow rate to not be limiting, resulting in 69.5 ± 13.4% (n = 58) of the oxygen remaining in the off gas.\nSamples were collected from Stage A and Stage B on a daily basis to calculate the growth (OD600), substrate consumption, and product formation (HPLC, GC; Experimental procedures, ESI†). Samples from both stages were also checked daily for potential contaminations with a phase contrast microscope (Nikon Labophot, Nikon, NY, USA). For protein determinations for Stage B, 2 mL samples were taken. The samples were collected by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm, washed with 1 mL of ddH2O, dissolved in 1 mL of 1 M NaOH, and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations in the broth of Stage B were determined with the Lowry method (Experimental procedures, ESI†).14 In addition, protein content of dried yeast biomass was determined with the Dumas method by an external laboratory (Dairy One Co-Op, Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA). For this, the entire broth (effluent of Stage B) throughout the sampling period of 1 day (1 L at 40 mL h−1 and 1.5 L at 60 mL h−1) was collected, centrifuged, and dried. Finally, the dried biomass was grinded and sent for analysis of crude protein, lipid, and ash content.\n", "output": {}}

A novel, facile and efficient one-pot method is proposed to directly synthesize the composites in supercritical CO2-ethanol medium. The influence of wt% rGO on both their physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activity have been studied. The most striking changes observed have been their large increase in the visible range absorbance and absorption thresholds as compared to commercial TiO2, both effects increasing with the amount of rGO. These findings later resulted in an improved electron charge transfer and a better photocatalytic activity of the composite catalysts with higher rGO content. Nevertheless, the best catalytic performance (7.4 µmol CO2/g TiO2·h conversion rate) was achieved when the binary rGO/TiO2 nanocomposite was doped with metallic Cu at 1 wt%, due to its better electron/hole separation as compared to rGO-TiO2.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "rGO/TiO2/Cu", "application": "photocatalytic CO2 reduction with water vapour and simulated solar light", "props": {"CO2_conversion_rate": "7.4 µmol CO2/g TiO2·h"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "rGO/TiO2", "application": "photocatalytic CO2 reduction", "props": {}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods 2.1 Powders characteristics The commercially available copper powder (99.7% purity, AMIL Werkstofftechnologie GmbH, Germany) was used for the matrix material of the sinters. Copper powder is characterized by a dendritic structure (Fig. 1 a). Non-commercial powders, that is, TiO2 nanopowder and multi-walled copper-decorated carbon nanotubes, were used as an additional material. The TiO2 powder is characterized by a spherical structure with dimensions of a single particle of about 25–45 nm. This powder is in the form of agglomerates. The method of obtaining nano TiO2 used to produce sinters in this article was presented in the work [25]. MWCNTs/Cu hybrids were synthesized via a wet chemistry method [45]. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes were coated with copper to improve the interfacial strength of the metal matrix and to reduce the effect of carbon nanotubes escaping to the surface during the preparation of powder mixtures and the production of moldings. This is due to their low density. As-purchased Nanocyl NC7000™ MWCNTs contain ca. 10 wt% of contamination. The contamination is composed mainly of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) support and iron-based phases which – in the synthesis via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) – serve as catalyst support and the actual growth catalyst, respectively [46]. TEM imaging (Fig. 1 c-e) revealed that the hybrid was composed of spheroidal, chain-like copper multi-nanograin (5–20 nm) nanoparticles of a total size of 50–150 nm – randomly dispersed among entangled, spaghetti-like nanotube 3D-network. The predisposition to agglomerate by MWCNTs is due to the van der Waals interaction [34,47,48]. Raman spectra were obtained using an InVia Renishaw at 785 nm (diode laser). Typical Raman spectra of pure anatase TiO2 are presented in Fig. 2 a. Four characteristic Raman active modes of anatase TiO2 were observed at 145, 399, 518, and 640 cm−1. Fig. 2 b shows the Raman spectra of MWCNTs/Cu hybrid with typical D band and G band at 1353 cm−1 and 1591 cm−1, respectively. The ID/IG ratio, which is a diagnostic of a number of crystallographic defects in graphene walls, is relatively high and is equal 1.07 ± 0.03 for MWCNTs/Cu powder and 1.17 ± 0.05 for MWCNTs/Cu in sinter [49]. Such a characteristic proved the presence, apart from the more developed graphitic domains, of defective centers such as sp3-carbon atoms, gaps and Stone-Wales (5-7-7-5) defects. Both centers could function as tethering points to anchor precursor Cu2+ ions. Such an initial coupling could be achieved via complexation of Cu2+ by delocalized π-electrons (formation of π-cation complex) and geometry-driven nesting the growing copper nanocrystals in the outer nanotube wall grooves, respectively [50]. Thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 3 ) performed in air allowed to combust the whole carbon into CO2 while oxidize copper nanoparticles to copper (II) oxide (CuO). This transformation was evident, in the plateau above 750 °C, and the overall weight gain above 400 °C – corresponding to the oxidation of metallic nanoparticles – is partially diminished by the counteracting weight loss driven by carbon combustion. Considering the above, the Cu content in the MWCNTs/Cu hybrids was equal to 44.35 wt%. TGA curves were recorded using a PerkinElmer TGA 8000 thermobalance in a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in air. 2.2 Sinters preparation Powder mixtures with the composition given in Table 1 were prepared from Cu, MWCNTs and nano TiO2 powders. The mixtures were milled for 1 h. In the next stage, the moldings were produced at a pressure of 1.17 GPa. The sintering process under argon was carried out at a temperature of 650 °C for 3 h. The sinters produced were approximately 2.5 mm high and approximately 4 mm in diameter. 2.3 Dilatometry In the research, the connecting rod dilatometer (LK02, Adamel Lhomargy, France) was used. Heat treatment was performed in the dilatometer furnace in an inert gas. The samples were heated and cooled at a rate of 0.07 °C/s and annealed at 650 °C/3h. The sample elongation change recording module was set to a magnification value of 1000 × . A type K thermocouple was used to measure the temperature. Dilatometric tests were performed under thermal conditions similar to those of the sintering process. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of MWCNTs and nano TiO2 on the dimensional changes of the samples during the sintering process. 2.4 Microstructure and mechanical properties The microstructure of the produced sinters was observed with a scanning electron microscope (Mira 3, Tescan, The Czech Republic) equipped with EDS (Oxford Instruments Ultim Max 65, UK). The EDS results are presented as qualitative superimposed qualitative maps of the distribution of the concentrations of copper, carbon, titanium, and oxygen. Nanoscale morphology of the MWNCTs/Cu hybrids was acquired using a transmission electron microscope (FEI-Tecnai F20 X-TWIN, Hillsboro, OR, USA) operating at 200 kV. The Vickers hardness tester (Falcon 500, INNOVATEST, The Netherlands) to measure the hardness of the sinters was used. The Vickers hardness tests were carried out with a load of 5 kgf and a dwell time of 15 s. Metallographic observations and hardness tests were carried out on metallographic polished samples prepared from sinters. The experimental investigation has been carried out on the testing machine (Z100, ZWICK, Germany) within the range of tensile load of 10 kN. The tests were carried out on a specially designed test stand with modified grips to compress samples with small external dimensions. The test results were recorded during the compression tests. The compressive stiffness of the test specimens in the range of 2000–6000 N was determined using the linear regression method from compression curves at the maximum load of 8000 N. 2.5 Wear tests The friction wear tests of sinters at room temperature and 600 °C were used with a pin-on-disc tribometer (T-21, Lukasiewicz Research Network – IST, Poland). Counter-specimens in the form of discs with a diameter of 25.4 mm and a height of 4 mm, adjusted to the test apparatus, were made of the commercial Inconel®625 nickel alloy (240 HV5). The friction tests were carried out under dry friction conditions for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and at 600 °C with a load of 5 N, linear speed 0.1 m/s. During the test, the friction forces were recorded for individual pairs of friction. Each of the wear tests was repeated three times. The friction coefficients were determined from the equation: (1) μ = F f F l , where: μ - friction coefficient, Ff - friction force [N]; Fl - load applied [N]. Relative mass changes were determined for the sinters and counter-specimens from the equation: (2) Δ m m 0 = m 0 − m f m 0 , where: Δm – mass loss [g], m 0 – initial mass [g], m f – final mass [g]. 2.6 Worn surfaces studies The worn surfaces of the sintered materials and the counter-specimens after wear tests were observed by the SEM (Tescan Mira3, The Czech Republic) equipped with EDS detector (Oxford Instruments Ultim Max 65, UK). In order to reduce the excitation zone, an accelerating voltage of 12 kV was used. The results were presented in the form of qualitative maps of the element concentration distribution on the color scale and quantitative analysis in representative places. The carbon content was not taken into account in the quantitative studies of EDS. Raman spectra of MWCNTs before and after wear tests were obtained using an InVia Renishaw at 785 nm (diode laser). A diffractometer (Empyrean, PANalytical, The Netherlands) equipped with a copper lamp (X-ray wavelength λ = 1.54060 Å) and an X'Celerator detector was used for the phase composition tests on the surfaces of the sinters after the friction process was performed. Diffractograms were recorded in an angular range of 25–100° 2Theta, in steps of 0.0170°, at room temperature. The phase analysis of the obtained diffractograms was carried out in the HighScore software equipped with the PDF-4 database.

With detailed experimental and theoretical characterization, we reveal that although the conformal graphene coating largely shields the catalytic activity and adsorbing ability of CoS nanosheets, the exposed interfaces of CoS at the defective sites of the graphene coating exhibit especially strong lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) anchoring and high conversion efficiency, with high-flux Li+ and electron transfer from the circumjacent graphene coating and the buried carbon nanofibers.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "3 Synthesis and characterization of IL-MOF composite materials In the synthesis of IL-MOF composites, the multifaceted nature of ILs proves indispensable. These versatile substances play pivotal roles in shaping the synthesis process and outcomes of MOFs, underpinning the creation of innovative composite materials [184]. ILs take on the dual role of solvents and structure-guiding agents, wielding influence over crystallization kinetics and the ultimate structures of MOFs (Fig. 10 ). By leveraging their unique solvent properties, ILs offer a conducive environment for the controlled growth of MOFs, allowing researchers to fine-tune the formation process [185,186]. Additionally, ILs serve as guiding agents, directing the assembly and arrangement of MOF components, thereby steering the eventual morphology and structure of the composite. Furthermore, ILs exhibit post-synthetic modification capabilities, enabling the alteration of MOF components to enhance the functionalities of IL-MOF composites. This approach opens avenues for tailoring the properties of the composite to specific applications. Through such modifications, IL-MOF composites can be engineered to possess augmented functions, rendering them more efficient and effective for desired purposes. 3.1 ILs as solvents in MOF synthesis In this section we will delve deeper into the intricate interplay between ILs and MOFs during the synthesis process, particularly focusing on the impact of ILs as solvents on MOF nucleation kinetics. The phenomenon of ILs influencing MOF nucleation kinetics stems from their unique properties as both solvents and potential interaction partners. ILs possess a distinctive ionic nature, with charged species that facilitate electrostatic interactions, and they also feature the capacity for hydrogen bonding [187,188]. These traits become crucial factors in the orchestration of MOF nucleation. When ILs are used as solvents in MOF synthesis, they provide a specialized environment where MOF precursor components can interact [189]. The electrostatic interactions between the charged species of ILs and the metal ions or ligands of MOF precursors establish a favorable platform for nucleation [180]. The attractive forces between oppositely charged entities drive the initial clustering of MOF building blocks around IL molecules, initiating the nucleation process [190]. Furthermore, hydrogen bonding interactions between ILs and MOF components also contribute significantly to nucleation kinetics. ILs, with their ability to form hydrogen bonds, engage with functional groups on MOF precursor molecules, promoting their assembly into growing MOF structures. This intricate web of interactions fosters the aggregation of MOF building blocks in close proximity to IL molecules. This combined effect of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding creates a unique microenvironment around ILs, fostering the growth of MOF nuclei. As these nuclei expand and mature, they eventually form the intricate frameworks characteristic of MOFs. As a proof of concept, Shan et al. [191] introduced a novel class of porous materials. This approach entailed a deliberate fusion of microporous framework nanoparticles serving as porous hosts with a robust IL as the solvent medium. The result was a truly remarkable material that combined the advantages of both porous solids and liquids, paving the way for a paradigm shift in various domains. The utilization of positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and CO2 adsorption measurements served as a testament to the successful engineering of permanent porosity within these unique liquids. The synthesized porous liquids exhibited remarkable traits distinct from conventional porous materials. One such feature was the pronounced hysteresis loops observed in CO2 sorption isotherms, even under ambient conditions. This emphasized the exceptional properties and behavior of these newly minted porous liquids. The implications of this innovation extend far and wide. The porous liquids' distinctive attributes hold the potential to improve diverse fields such as gas separation and storage, air separation and regeneration, gas transport, and the ambitious prospect of permanent gas storage under ambient conditions. Additionally, Zhang et al. [192] introduces an innovative approach utilizing nanoscale functionalized ILs as building blocks for the synthesis of mesoporous materials. This method presents a significant advancement, yielding a series of nanoscale meso-MIL-101 structures built upon the foundation of MIL-101 (Cr) framework (Fig. 11 a). The novelty of this approach lies in the incorporation of aromatic rings, encompassing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, within the anionic components of the ILs. By skillfully integrating these functional groups, the researchers achieved a tailored synthesis and mesoporous construction strategy. The subsequent assembly process involved the formation of MIL-101 structures through in situ supramolecular self-assembly, leveraging the unique properties of the nanoscale functionalized ILs. An intriguing aspect of this method is the in situ introduction of ILs, which not only preserved the inherent framework properties of MIL-101 but also facilitated the construction of mesopores. This integration of ILs introduced multifunctional active sites into the structure, thereby presenting a novel pathway to ideal functional mesoporous materials. The resulting nanoscale meso-MIL-101 structures hold the promise of multifaceted applications, thanks to their combined characteristics of framework stability, microporosity, and versatile active sites. Sun’s research team [193] presented a design of hierarchical porous MOFs using a multifunctional IL as a sole medium for construction (Fig. 11b). This approach circumvents the need for additional media, streamlining the synthesis process. The IL in question is based on poly(ethylene glycol)-based alkylammonium and bromide, featuring multifunctional properties that are key to the success of the method. One of the pivotal features of this multifunctional IL is its ability to dissolve MOF precursors efficiently. This solubilization is facilitated by the presence of a poly(ethylene glycol) chain within the IL, which serves as a solubilizer. Additionally, the ionic moiety within the IL plays a crucial role by fostering electrostatic interactions, thus creating a templating effect that guides the MOF's formation. Through this technique, the research team successfully fabricated hierarchical porosity within a specific MOF called UiO-66. This hierarchical porosity enhances the MOF's efficiency by creating more intricate internal structures. Notably, this methodology isn't limited to UiO-66; it can be extended to the construction of other hierarchical porous MOFs. The resulting hierarchical UiO-66 exhibits remarkable capabilities, particularly in the encapsulation of bulky biomolecules like cytochrome c. The adsorption capacity of hierarchical UiO-66 surpasses that of its microporous counterpart, showcasing the advantages of hierarchical porosity. Lin et al. [194] introduced a significant breakthrough in the realm of chiral materials through the creation of a novel chiral MOF. This achievement was made possible by utilizing a chiral ILs in an ionothermal synthesis approach (Fig. 11c). Central to this innovation is the incorporation of l-aspartate, a chiral component, into the IL precursor. Remarkably, the introduction of this chiral component induced chirality within the resulting solid MOF structure. This is a remarkable outcome, especially considering that the anion of the IL is not occluded within the material, and the MOF itself is constructed solely from nonchiral building blocks. Interestingly, this chiral effect is not observed when the chiral component is absent from the IL precursor. Under the same synthesis conditions, an achiral compound is formed. This dichotomy underscores the critical role of the chiral component in dictating the chirality of the resulting MOF. This result opens exciting possibilities in the realm of chiral materials synthesis. The ability to impart chirality to a material solely through the inclusion of a chiral component in the precursor, without relying on chiral building blocks, presents a new avenue for the preparation of chiral materials. Moreover, Han's research group [195] introduced a transformative approach to the formation of Zr-based MOFs by employing an IL as the solvent to accelerate the nucleation process. This experience greatly speeds up the creation of MOF, even at room temperature, and produces exceptional outcomes. In this groundbreaking work, the researchers demonstrated that the incorporation of an IL as a solvent led to a drastic reduction in reaction time. For instance, the formation of Zr-based MOFs was achieved in just 0.5 h using 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, whereas the conventional solvent N,N-dimethylformamide necessitated a significantly longer reaction time of at least 120 h. The mechanism driving this accelerated synthesis was meticulously explored through a combination of analytical techniques (Fig. 11d). In situ investigations using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, spectroscopy synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray absorption fine structure provided insights into the reaction process. This comprehensive analysis shed light on the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the enhanced efficiency of IL-assisted synthesis. The resultant Zr-based MOF nanoparticles exhibited exceptional attributes. These nanoparticles boasted a small particle size, showcased missing-linker defects, and possessed a large surface area. These characteristics rendered them highly suitable as heterogeneous catalysts for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reaction. Han's research group has not only introduced an innovative approach to MOF synthesis using ILs but also illuminated the intricate mechanisms driving this accelerated process. This route not only revolutionizes MOF formation but also lays the groundwork for advanced applications such as catalysis, tapping into the remarkable potential of IL-mediated MOF synthesis for diverse scientific and industrial endeavors. 3.2 Post-synthetic modification The concept of post-synthesis modification has emerged as a transformative strategy in the field of material engineering, specifically in the creation of tailored composites marrying the unique attributes of ILs and MOF structures. This innovative approach introduces a multifaceted process that begins with the initial fabrication of MOFs, establishing a foundational structure. Subsequently, ILs, known for their liquid nature, low vapor pressure, and propensity for interactions with porous surfaces, are seamlessly integrated into the MOF framework. This integration is meticulously orchestrated, capitalizing on the intrinsic compatibility between ILs and MOFs. The result is a composite material that encapsulates the essence of both constituents, effectively amalgamating their properties and structures. The synergy between the versatile characteristics of ILs and the intricate architecture of MOFs culminates in a composite that transcends the sum of its parts, offering a harmonious blend of functionalities. The post-synthesis modification methodology stands as a versatile platform for customizing materials, empowering researchers to fine-tune the resultant composite's traits to precise specifications. By strategically harnessing the strengths of ILs and MOFs, this approach opens up a panorama of opportunities across scientific, industrial, and technological landscapes, enabling the design of innovative materials with tailored properties for applications ranging from catalysis to sensing and beyond. In this vein, Du’s research group [196] developed an innovative strategy that showcases the potential of in situ polymerization of ILs confined within the pores of MOFs (Fig. 12 ). This breakthrough methodology results in the creation of polyILs@MOFs composites that exhibit remarkable enhancements in the sequestration of TcO4 − ions compared to the pristine MOFs. A notable aspect of this approach is the utilization of cross-linked polymerization of ILs, which serves a dual purpose: creating active sites within the MOF's internal structure while forming protective layers around its exterior. The cross-linked polymerization process is pivotal in facilitating the development of active sites within the composite's ionic filler, while simultaneously generating protective coatings on the MOFs' surface. This tandem effect greatly contributes to the overall stability and resilience of the composite, making it exceptionally well-suited for harsh conditions such as exposure to a highly acidic environment. This unique design enables the composite to maintain its exceptional sorption performance under extreme circumstances. The resultant optimized composite exhibits an array of impressive attributes. The rapid sorption kinetics, with a response time of less than 30 s, coupled with robust regeneration capabilities extending beyond 30 cycles, underscores the versatility and efficiency of this approach. Notably, the composite displays superior uptake performance for TcO4 − ions in both highly acidic conditions and simulated recycle streams. This innovative strategy not only showcases the potential of in situ polymerization within MOFs but also opens new avenues for constructing highly stable composite materials. The composite's exceptional stability and efficiency broaden its potential applications across diverse fields. In same context, Huang et al. [197] achieved a remarkable feat by seamlessly incorporating bisimidazolium-based ILs into the framework of MOFs using a pioneering combination of immersion grinding and in-situ polymerization techniques (Fig. 13 ). The tightly bonded integration of studied IL within and around the porous MOF matrix through uniform immersion grinding establishes channels that enhance exposure to adsorption sites and facilitate the rapid movement of anions. This novel methodology not only enhances performance but also emphasizes environmental sustainability, as solvent-free polymerization minimizes both pollution and energy consumption. Of significant note is the resulting composite, P[C4(VIM)2]Cl2@MIL-101, which stands as an exemplar of outstanding removal efficiency with a notably high value compared to pristine poly-ILs. Impressively, the composite also demonstrates rapid sorption kinetics, achieving a remarkable 92 % removal in just 2 min. Moreover, it exhibits substantial resilience to β and γ radiation, excellent regenerative capacity, and exceptional performance even under high alkaline conditions, registering an 83 % removal efficiency. These attributes collectively enable composite to excel in the separation of TcO4 − ions from simulated Hanford Low-activity Waste Melter off-gas scrubber solutions. The underlying mechanisms supporting these exceptional traits are elucidated through DFT density functional theory, unveiling a strong electrostatic attraction and minimal Gibbs free energy, ensuring high selective adsorption for TcO4 −. This composite thus possesses significant potential for the removal of TcO4 − from radioactive contaminants, underscoring its value in addressing critical environmental challenges. Recently, Zhang's research team [81] reported three distinct ILs with similar chemical structures but varying molecular sizes to fabricate nanoscale ILs@UiO-66-NH2 composites through an innovative in situ encapsulation method (Fig. 14 a). This marks the first instance of such composite formation. The investigation delved into the intricate interplay between the molecular size of ILs, the pore size of MOFs, and the resultant loading capacity of ILs within the composite. As anticipated, the optimized ILs@MOF composite-based humidity sensor emerges as a standout performer. It exhibits exceptional sensing capabilities across an extensive humidity range spanning from 5 % to 95 % relative humidity. The sensor showcases several impressive attributes including minimal hysteresis, rapid response and recovery times, and exceptional long-term stability (Fig. 14). Notably, the sensor excels even in low humidity detection. This breakthrough work not only advances the field of humidity sensing but also provides valuable insights into the encapsulation of ILs within the MOF framework. The success of this novel approach underscores its potential for revolutionizing the design and fabrication of composite materials with enhanced functionalities. The team's findings present a pioneering pathway toward harnessing the capabilities of MOFs and ILs for sensor applications, setting the stage for a new era of innovation in material science and sensor technology. Based on the abovementioned studies, the variable synthesis approaches used for IL-MOF composites, along with the capability to customize their physicochemical properties, contribute significantly to their exceptional performance. However, it is important to note that IL-MOF synthesis methods often involve intricate procedures that may present scalability challenges for industrial applications. Therefore, selecting a task-specific preparation technique is crucial. The mechanism and strength of molecular interactions between ILs and MOFs vary significantly with different in-situ or post-synthesis techniques, leading in completely different IL-MOF composites in terms of both characteristics and performance. For instance, the size of relatively large IL molecules can create steric hindrance, preventing them from entering zeolite cages. This situation requires employing an in-situ synthesis method, such as “ship-in-a-bottle,” to encapsulate IL molecules within the cages. Additionally, during ionothermal synthesis of IL-based MOFs, some studies have observed structures where only one constituent of the IL is incorporated into the MOF, while the other constituent remains in solution to maintain the surface neutrality of the resulting hybrid material [198,199]. For this synthesis technique, the desired properties of ILs cannot be effectively achieved within the hybrid material due to limited control over the final structural design. Therefore, in the context of MOFs, employing post-synthesis techniques to incorporate IL can offer greater flexibility and advantages in leveraging IL's desired properties like gas solubility and ion mobility. Conversely, for negatively charged zeolite structures, post-synthesis techniques result in composites that typically contain only the cationic component of the IL, while the anionic part remains in solution [200]. As a result, the structural integrity of the ILs is generally compromised in these materials. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a detailed assessment of the benefits and drawbacks of different preparation techniques to guide further research studies effectively. 3.3 Characterization of IL-MOF composites The purpose of this section is to comprehensively examine the characterization techniques used to analyze the physical and chemical properties, including hydrophobicity, crystal structure, pore size distribution, surface area, elemental composition, surface interactions, and morphology of IL-MOF composites. The rational design of new IL-MOF composites relies on several key factors: (i) understanding the specific amounts of IL and porous material within the composite; (ii) elucidating the interactions between IL molecules and the MOF materials; (iii) recognizing how these interactions depend on the structures of the individual components; and (iv) assessing their impact on various adsorption and regeneration performances. As has been demonstrated, tuning the anions, cations, and compositions of the ILs incorporated into the MOFs can effectively modify many properties of the host material. Therefore, several characterization techniques have been employed to gain insight into the physical and chemical changes occurring within the host material upon the incorporation of ILs. Among these techniques, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are particularly effective for quantifying the IL loading in IL-based ZIF-8 frameworks [201,202]. However, determining the IL loading in non-functionalized carbonaceous materials such as activated carbon, graphene, or carbon black is not possible because these materials lack distinctive elemental species. Therefore, it is essential that both the host and guest materials in IL composites contain at least one distinct elemental species for accurate determination of IL loading [203]. In such cases, alternative characterization methods like thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) or quantitative washing experiments can be used to confirm the formation of a newly synthesized hybrid material [178,204]. As demonstrated, incorporating ILs into MOFs introduces abundant ionic sites that facilitate preferential interactions, including hydrogen bonding, π − π interactions, van der Waals interactions, and acid − base interactions. These interactions enhance the affinity of the composite material towards target molecules and can be identified with the help of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FTIR spectra provide detailed information about newly formed inter- and intra-molecular interactions by detecting shifts (either red-shifts or blue-shifts) in specific characteristic IR fingerprint peaks. To delve deeper into the morphology, particle size, and distribution of IL-MOF materials at micro and nano scales, techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy can be employed to examine alterations in morphology and crystal structure resulting from the addition of IL. Besides, the unique and synergistic functionalities exhibited on the surface of the composites can be characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to gain insights into the nature of these interactions. Moreover, incorporating advanced techniques such as layer-by-layer etching with XPS allows for the identification of IL accumulation sites and facilitates the characterization of IL layer formation on the surface of the composites. In addition to that, gas sorption techniques such as Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis are essential for assessing the adsorption capacities of IL-MOF composites. However, in practice, BET may yield unreliable results due to the poor solubility of nitrogen in ILs, especially under the measurement conditions involving liquid nitrogen temperatures. The aforementioned characterization techniques, along with others, are crucial for elucidating the structural, morphological, and chemical properties of IL-MOF composites. Evaluating each characterization technique is equally important across different application areas to achieve a fundamental understanding of the relationships between structure and performance.", "output": {}}

Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4) (97%), cupper nitrate Cu(NO3)2.3H2O (99.99%), Aniline (99.99%), HCl (99.99%), Ammonium persulphate ((NH4)2S2O8) (99.99%) and hydrazine hydrate (80%) were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich, Co., Ltd. Absolute ethanol (99%) was supplied from Adwic.\nSynthesis methods\nSynthesis of nano pure TiO2\nUsing the sol–gel approach, nano pure TiO2 was created [36, 37]. 10 millilitres of titanium(IV) isopropoxide was slowly poured into 200 millilitres of double-distilled water while being vigorously stirred. The generated white precipitate was filtered, repeatedly cleaned with water, and dried at 60 °C.\nPreparation of nano cupper – doped TiO2\nThe traditional impregnation technique was used to create nano cupper-doped TiO2 [38]. To obtain 5 wt% of cupper, a solution comprising the manufactured nano TiO2 dispersed in ethanol was mixed with a specific amount of cupper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O). After the impregnation procedure, the mixture is thoroughly mixed to create a uniform paste. The sample was first dried for an entire night at 80 °C, and then it was calcined for three hours at 500 °C in the air.\nPreparation of nano nitrogen—doped TiO2\nThe previously manufactured nano-TiO2 powder was submerged in a hydrazine hydrate at 110 °C to create nano nitrogen-doped TiO2 [36, 37]. The white nano-TiO2 powders were soaked in a specific amount of hydrazine hydrate (80%) for 12 h while being stirred to extract 15% of the nitrogen. The precipitate was then filtered and allowed to dry for three hours at 110 degrees Celsius in the air.\nPreparation of polyaniline\nThe following steps of the in-situ oxidative polymerization process were taken to generate polyaniline: 100 ml of an aqueous solution containing 1 M HCl and 1.8 ml of aniline. Next, at a temperature of 0–5ºC, 100 ml of ammonium persulphate ((NH4)2S2O8; 0.025 M) was added to the aforesaid solution slowly for two hours while vigorously stirring. The resultant dark green precipitate was filtered, and it was repeatedly washed with distilled water and 1 M HCl till the filtrate lost its colour. Distilled water was used to re-filter and wash the precipitate. To obtain polyaniline, it was finally dried for 12 h at 90 °C.\nPreparation of polyaniline nanocomposites\nThe polyaniline nanocomposites were synthesized using the oxidative polymerization of acidic solution (HCl) of aniline in presence of pure nano TiO2. The added concentration of pure nano TiO2 was 25 wt. %. On a regular basis, 100 ml of 1.8 ml aniline in 1 M HCl with nanoparticle-pure TiO2 was ultrasonically treated for one hour. Next, for four hours at 0–5 ºC, 100 ml of ammonium persulphate (0.025 M) was added to the aforementioned solution while being vigorously stirred. Once the precipitate was colourless, it was filtered and repeatedly cleaned with distilled water and acetone. Ultimately, the final product was dried for 12 h at 90 °C in an oven.\nThe other polyaniline nanocomposites were prepared using the same previous procedure steps, in presence of the same concentration (25 wt. %) of both nitrogen-doped polyaniline and cupper–doped polyaniline.\nAll obtained polyaniline and its nanocomposites were denoted as P, NPC, NDPC1 and NDPC2 for pure polyaniline, polyaniline containing nano pure TiO2, polyaniline containing nano cupper–doped TiO2 and polyaniline containing nano nitrogen-doped TiO2, respectively.

Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) was used to record the XRD patterns at 10 mA and 36 kV. Sample morphologies were examined using a 200 kV FEI, model Tecnai G20, Super twin, double tilt 1010. A twin beam Perkin Elmer spectrometer was used to track the FT-IR spectra in the 400–4000 cm–1 range. The samples were placed into the sample holder after being combined with KBr (1:100) to create tablets. Using a traditional volumetric apparatus (Quantachrome NOVA Automated), the surface parameters; BET surface area, total pore volume (Vp) and mean pore radius (r) were assessed via the adsorption of N2 gas at 77 K. To ascertain the distribution of pore sizes, BJH analysis was employed.

The detailed parameters of 3D copper foam: the porosity is about 96%, the area density is 600 g m−2, the aperture is about 0.19 mm and the purity is above 99.9%. The electroless Sn plating solution is produced by Beichen Hardware Technology Co., Ltd., No. BC035. The preparation steps of Cu6Sn5@Cu foam are as follows. First, the Cu foam was washed with absolute ethanol (analytical pure, Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technology Co., Ltd.), 1 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid (analytical pure, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) and deionized water in sequence for 5 min. The cleaned Cu foam was dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 2 h, and then placed it in the Sn plating bath for 10 s. Sn@Cu foam was obtained after cleaning the excess plating solution on the surface. The Sn@Cu foam was also vacuum dried at 60 ℃ for 2 h. After drying, the Cu6Sn5@Cu foam electrodes were obtained. The schematic diagram of the process is shown in Fig. 1 . 2.2 Preparation of LiFePO4 cathode LiFePO4 (LFP) powder was mixed with Super-P carbon black and poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in N-methylpyrro-lidone (NMP) solvent with a mass ratio of 8:1:1. Grinded the mixture by hand for 30 min, then added it to a volumetric flask and stirred it magnetically for 24 h, then smeared the mixture on aluminum foil (Al ≥ 99.7%). The aluminum foil was punched into a disc with a diameter of 13 cm after been dried at 120 °C. (LFP, Super-P carbon and PVDF is from Beiterui New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. NMP is from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., analytical pure) 2.3 Structure characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku mini Flex600X) was used to characterize the structure of Cu foam, Sn@Cu foam and Cu6Sn5@Cu foam at a scanning rate of 10° min−1 from 20° to 80°. The morphology of the electrodes was obtained by scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM 450). The element distribution on the electrode surface was obtained by the energy dispersive X-ray attached to the SEM. Lattice fringes and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was obtained by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 TF30 S-Twin). Used a handheld industrial microscope, No. Shenhong-1600, to observe the surface deposition process of Li metal on Cu6Sn5@Cu foam and Cu foam electrodes in situ online. The electrolyte was composed of 1 mol L-1 bis (trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and 1,3-dioxolane/dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME, v/v 1:1) with 1 wt% LiNO3 (Suzhou Duoduo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd.). The current density was 1 mA cm−2, and the effective deposition area in the electrolyte was 1 cm2. The schematic diagram of in-situ online observation is shown in Fig. 2 . 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical performance test of Cu foam and Cu6Sn5@Cu foam electrodes was carried out by using CR2032-type coin cells in an argon-filled glove box. The electrolyte used 1 mol L-1 bis (trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and 1,3-dioxolane/dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME, v/v 1:1) with 1 wt% LiNO3, and the separator used Celgard 2400. The charge–discharge cycle performance at different current densities and capacities of Cu foam | Li and Cu6Sn5@Cu foam | Li batteries were tested using the LAND CT-2001A battery test system with a charge cut-off voltage of 0.5 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested with an electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT302N) at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The measurement process of Li+ migration numbers is as follows. The two assembled half-cells were short-circuited with wires to balance the potential of the battery. Test the electrolyte/electrode interface impedance R0 before the battery was polarized at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz (disturbance voltage 5 mV). The electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) was used to measure the potentiostatic time–current curve (I-T curve) at a polarization voltage ΔV of 5 mV, the initial current I0 and the stabilized current Is were recorded. Then the polarized electrolyte/electrode interface impedance Rs was tested under the same conditions as R0. The calculation formula of Li+ migration number is as follows [52]: (1) T Li + = I s ( Δ V - I 0 R 0 ) I 0 ( Δ V - I s R s ) After pre-plated with Li for the half cells, the Cu foam and Cu6Sn5@Cu foam electrodes were assembled with the LFP cathode to full batteries. The LFP full cells were pre-circulated at 0.1C for 2 cycles before performing a long cycle at 1C. The electrolyte used in the full cells was the same as the half cells, and the voltage range was 2.5–4.0 V.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Cu6Sn5@Cu foam", "Syns_method": "electroless Sn plating", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Cu foam"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "2 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "plate", "parameters": {"time": "10 s"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "LiFePO4", "Syns_method": "slurry coating", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "LiFePO4", "amount": "8 parts"}, "prc2": {"name": "Super-P carbon black", "amount": "1 part"}, "prc3": {"name": "PVDF", "amount": "1 part"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "grind", "parameters": {"time": "30 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "punch", "parameters": {"shape": "disc with diameter 13 cm"}}}}}}}

TiO2 was purchased from Grupa Azoty (Poland). (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (C9H23NO3Si, APTES) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Glucose (C6H12O6) was purchased from Chempur. Toluene (C7H8) and ethanol (C2H6O) were supplied by StanLab. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of a titania-silica composite (Ti/Si) Firstly, TiO2 was functionalized with APTES. Briefly, TiO2 (1 g) was dispersed in 125 ml of toluene via stirring (0.5 h) and ultrasonication (1 h). Afterwards, a homogeneous dispersion was poured into a round-bottomed 3-neck flask. Then, the setup was stirred and heated under reflux. When the temperature reached 110 °C, the APTES (10 µl) was added drop by drop to the mixture and a solvothermal reaction was carried out for 24 h. After that, the white product was decanted using an ultracentrifuge and washed several times with toluene and pure ethanol. The obtained powder was dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The sample produced in this step was named Ti/Si. 2.2.2 Coating titania-silica composite with carbon (Ti/Si/C) In the second step, carbon-coated Ti/Si nanoparticles were produced via a hydrothermal reaction. Here, Ti/Si powder (80 mg) and glucose (1.6 g) were dispersed in a mixture of ethanol and water (80 ml, volume proportion 1:4) using ultrasonication. Next, a dispersion was poured into a Teflon liner and autoclaved. The solvothermal reaction was conducted at 190 °C for 20 h. After that, the dark-brown powder was decanted using an ultracentrifuge and washed several times with pure ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The produced sample was labelled Ti/Si/C. 2.2.3 Carbonization of titania-silica-carbon composites (Ti/Si/C-Tx) Finally, the Ti/Si/C brown powder was carbonized in a tube furnace. The heating process was conducted at 600, 700 and 800 °C for 2 h (nitrogen flow, 100 sccm). The obtained samples were marked as Ti/Si/C-600, Ti/Si/C-700 and Ti/Si/C-800, respectively. To remove any impurities, all produced materials were purified by stirring with a deionized water (DI)/hydrochloric acid solution (volume proportion 1:1) and separated via filtration. After that, the samples were washed several times with DI and dried at 70 °C for 12 h. 2.3 Zn-ion capacitor 2.3.1 Production of a working electrode The Zn-ion capacitor cathode was 10 mm diameter circles cut from Zn foil. The anode was produced from 100.0 mg of active material and carbonized powder (an active material), 10.0 mg of acetylene black and 10.0 mg of Kynar Flex PVDF. The powder was covered with anhydrous acetone in plastic containers and homogenized via Benchmark D1000 Homogenizer (for at least 60 s). Next, the mixture was transferred to a glass vessel and dried to evaporate acetone. After that, the graphite foil (GF) 10.0 mm in diameter, and 125 µm in thickness was coated with the active materials. Electrodes were dried overnight in a vacuum oven (15 mbar, 100 °C). Dry electrode materials were weighed and stored in a vacuum dryer. 2.3.2 Assembly zinc-ion capacitors The Zn-ion capacitor was assembled into a CR2032 button cell. Zn foil (cathode) was put on the spacer, then on top of that the separator (made of glass fibre) was placed, and 2 M ZnSO4·6 H2O was dropped in the amount of 0.25 µl. The coin was closed via an Oil Hydraulic Press Machine, using 100 MPa pressure. Electrochemical properties were measured by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) analysis at different scan ratios of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 mV/s, in the potential between 0.0 and + 1.6 V, Galvanostatic Cycling with Potential Limitation method (GCPL) at current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 A/g, in potential between 0.0 and + 1.6 V, and Potential Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (PEIS) in a frequency range between 10.00 mHz and 200.00 kHz, at 10.00 mV amplitude at a steady point of Open Circuit Potential (OCP), on the multichannel potentiostat VMP-3 (BioLogic) at room temperature.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Ti/Si", "Syns_method": "solvothermal reaction", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "TiO2", "amount": "1 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "APTES", "amount": "10 µl"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C7H8", "amount": "125 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "110 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ultracentrifuge"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "C7H8"}, {"name": "C2H5OH"}]}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Ti/Si/C", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal reaction", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ti/Si", "amount": "80 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "C6H12O6", "amount": "1.6 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C2H5OH", "amount": "16 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "64 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "190 °C", "time": "20 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ultracentrifuge"}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "C2H5OH"}]}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "Ti/Si/C-600", "Syns_method": "carbonization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ti/Si/C"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "carbonize", "parameters": {"temperature": "600 °C", "time": "2 h", "gas": "nitrogen (100 sccm)"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "purify", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "HCl", "amount": "volume proportion 1:1 with DI water"}]}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "H2O"}]}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "Ti/Si/C-700", "Syns_method": "carbonization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ti/Si/C"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "carbonize", "parameters": {"temperature": "700 °C", "time": "2 h", "gas": "nitrogen (100 sccm)"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "purify", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "HCl", "amount": "volume proportion 1:1 with DI water"}]}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "H2O"}]}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}, "MAT5": {"name": "Ti/Si/C-800", "Syns_method": "carbonization", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ti/Si/C"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "carbonize", "parameters": {"temperature": "800 °C", "time": "2 h", "gas": "nitrogen (100 sccm)"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "purify", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "HCl", "amount": "volume proportion 1:1 with DI water"}]}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"substances": [{"name": "H2O"}]}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental\nMaterials\nAMPS monomer (Sigma-Aldrich Co. St. Louis, MO, USA), acrylic acid (AA) monomer, ammonium persulfate (APS) radical polymerization initiator, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) as radical polymerization activator, hydrochloric acid 37%, and ethanol were all obtained from Merck, Germany. TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained from Notrino Co, Iran, consisting of rutile and anatase allotrope in 20:80 wt.% ratio with the mean size of 20 nm. Furthermore, a silane coupling agent (3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate, MPS, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) stabilizer, and deionized water were used. The epoxy resin, EPON 828, was used with the epoxide equivalent weight of 185–192 g/eq and the viscosity of 11–15 Pa.s. The epoxy resin was diluted with the reactive diluent, ED 180, with the viscosity of 0.015–0.025 Pa.s. The polyaminoamide curing agent, Merginamide A280, was employed with the viscosity of 1–2 Pa.s and amine value of 0.25–0.29 g KOH/g [13].\nPreparation of MPS-functionalized nano-TiO2 (MT)\nThe surface modification of TiO2 nanoparticles was carried out by MPS in water/ethanol (1:4 v/v) solution. Firstly, TiO2 nanoparticles were held in the oven at 100 °C for 24 h and then were dispersed in the water/ethanol solution using ultra-sonication for 1 h. After that, the MPS with the ratio of 3:1 w/w was added drop by drop to the TiO2 stirring solution. The solution was alternatively refluxed at 70 °C using a 300 rpm agitation rate for 8 h. The obtained slurry was centrifuged to separate the particles from the solvent (30 min at 4000 rpm) and then ethanol washed three times to remove the physically absorbed MPS on the TiO2 surface. The modified nanoparticles were then dried in an oven at 50 °C overnight [21]. Scheme 1 shows the modification reactions of TiO2 nanoparticles by MPS. After the hydrolysis process, MPS approaches the TiO2 nanoparticles through the hydrogen bonding. The condensation reaction occurs between MPS and TiO2 nanoparticle. The reaction produces water as a byproduct. Consequently, MPS is chemically functionalized through absorption on the TiO2 nanoparticle surface.\nScheme 1\nFunctionalization process of TiO2 nanoparticles by MPS hydrolysis and condensation reaction between MPS and TiO2 nanoparticle.\nFull size image\nSynthesis of MT-AA/AMPS nanogel composite\nThe MT-AA/AMPS nanogel composite was synthesized via the in-situ polymerization method through the following process: 0.2 g of MT and 0.045 g SDS were dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonication for 30 min and was then poured into a four-necked reactor. AMPS and AA monomers were dissolved in deionized water in an AMPS/AA 3:7 M ratio and the pH of the solution was subsequently set to 8 ± 0.5 using NaOH solution [22]. The solution was then added dropwise to the reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen line, a condenser, and a thermometer. In order to better control of the reaction temperature, the reactor was located in an oil bath. The polymerization process started with the addition of APS (1.5 wt.%) and TEMED (30 μL) solution to the reactor after 5 h of continuous stirring and 80 °C heating [23]. The final suspension slurry was allowed to cool down to room temperature and subsequently precipitated using acetone, which followed by ethanol washing. The final white product was held in an oven at 40 °C to reach a fixed weight. Finally, a mesh number 200 was used before the incorporation of MT-AA/AMPS nanogel composite into the epoxy resin. The synthesis procedure of MT-AA/AMPS nanogel composite is schematically shown in Scheme 2.\nScheme 2\nSynthesis of the TiO2 nanogel composite.\nFull size image\nPreparation of epoxy nanocomposite coating\nInitially, the surface of the St-37 steel substrate was abraded by sandpapers followed by acetone washing to degrease the surface. The epoxy resin was mixed with the diluent according to our previous work [13]. A mechanical mixer with 200 rpm was utilized to disperse the prepared MT-AA/AMPS nanogel composite into the epoxy resin in different weight percent (1, 2, and 4) with respect to the weight of epoxy resin and its hardener. Then, the epoxy resin and the hardener were combined according to the datasheet in a ratio of 100:58. The prepared resin was then applied on the St-37 steel panels by a film applicator (ZEHTNER ZAU 2000.80). The curing process of the coated panels took 7 days at room temperature. The final thickness of the coating was measured to be 150 μm. The cured samples were scratched up to reaching the substrate surface using a razor blade.\nCharacterization\nTo ensure successful functionalization of the TiO2 nanoparticles and the grafting of AA/AMPS copolymer gel on MT, FTIR analysis was carried out in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 using a FTIR spectrometer (Ray-Leigh WQF-510A FTIR) through KBr pellets method.\nThe ash content of the samples was measured using an Electric Muffle Furnace (SHINSAENG, SEF-202P, Korea). The samples were firstly weighed by a 4-digit weight balance and then heated from room temperature to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C and were kept for 30 min at 700 °C and after cooling again were weighted.\nXRD tests were carried out using a diffractometer (ASENWARE, AW-XDM300) by CuKα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA to confirm the grafting between the MT and the AA/AMPS gel. For all samples, the diffraction angle ranged from 5 to 80 with step size and a step time of 0.05 and 1 s, respectively.\nTo investigate the morphology of the synthesized nanogel composite, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM, Quanta 450 FEG) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDS, Octane Elite EDS) have been utilized. All samples were coated by the gold layer before undergoing the tests. To calculate the average size and distribution of the TiO2 nanogel composite, 100 measurements were used from FESEM images by ImageJ software. Moreover, the EDS was exploited to verify the distribution of MT in the AA/AMPS copolymer gel.\nThe swelling of the absorbent nanogel was calculated using the free swelling method. According to the mentioned method, the swelling ratio is reported in grams of absorbed water per grams of dry nanogel composite. Hence, 1 g of the prepared nanogel composite was immersed in 250 ml distilled water and then was weighted at different times until reaching a constant weight. The amount of swelling ratio (SR) was calculated according to Eq. 1 [23, 24]:\n$$ SR=\\left(\\frac{W2-W1}{W1}\\right) $$\n (1) \nwhere W2 and W1 refer to the weights of the sample after and before swelling, respectively.\nRoughness characterization of the coating\nThe surface roughness of the neat epoxy coating and the epoxy coatings containing different amounts (1, 2, and 4 wt.%) of the MT-AA/AMPS nanogel composite was assessed by surface profilometry (Mitutoyo, SJ210 V.1.008, USA). The roughness parameters, roughness average (Ra), root mean square value (Rq), and highest roughness (Rmax) were measured three times, and the average values were reported for interpretation of the results.\nSelf-healing performance of the coating\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization, Tafel, have been employed with an electrochemical workstation setup of a three-electrode system in order to analyze the corrosion and self-healing behavior of the coatings [25]. The epoxy coatings, Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl, and platinum rod are the three electrodes working as the working electrode, the reference electrode, and the counter electrode, respectively. The scratched samples were exposed to a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution with a precise area of 0.785 cm2. In order to carry out the EIS test, all the samples were assessed in the frequency sweep of 105 to 10−2 Hz at open circuit potential (OCP), while the amplitude sinusoidal voltage was set at 10 mV. Meanwhile, to evaluate the parameters of polarization, the Tafel extrapolation method was applied in the scan rate of 1 mV/s.\nBesides the quantitative self-healing investigations, visual inspection of the coated samples was carried out by the salt spray test.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Material From LABAL Chemie (India), we purchased nickel Nitrate Hexahydrate (Ni (NO3)2.6H2O) and Copper Nitrate Trihydrate (Cu (NO3)2.3H2O). In this thesis, the following sources were consulted: Piochem for Laboratory Chemicals in Egypt provided the following ingredients: (1,4 benzene dicarboxylic acid)(BDC), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), Methanol (Me–OH), urea, sodium acetate (CH3COONa.3H2O), ethanol, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). There was no need for further purification of any of the better preparations. Palma pollen grain was obtained from Beni-Suef Egyptian market. 2.2 Synthesis of (Ni/Cu/N) MOF Generally, the synthesis of (Ni/Cu/N) MOF (with an equimolar ratio) was prepared through the solvothermal method. Typically, 0.5 mmol of each metal nitrate precursor and 0.5 mmol of BDC were dissolved in 30 mL of DMF by stirring subsequently a few drops of urea (0.6g in 10 ml D.W) and solution were added to raise the pH to 6. Following thorough mixing, the liquid was put into a 100 mL autoclave lined with Teflon and heated for 12 h at 120 °C. The autoclave was then allowed to spontaneously cool to ambient temperature. Ultimately, the crystals were collected using centrifugation and repeatedly cleaned with ethanol and distilled water. Finally, the product was dried for 12 h at 70 °C in an oven. (Ni/Cu/N) MOFs were collected and kept for use. 2.3 Synthesis of green graphite (G-graphite) Palm pollen grain was obtained from Beni-Suef Egyptian market. The palm pollen grains were sieved- and placed in a ceramic crucible, which was then covered with a ceramic lid. This small crucible sits inside a bigger one, with the gap among them filled with charcoal powder. To protect material from the reaction with air, this double crucible setup was made even better by the addition of a third crucible. Continued in a tube furnace tube and sintered at 800 °C for 1h at with heating rate of 3 °C/min. After allowing it to cool to ambient temperature, the collected residue has been ground once more at room temperature. Pestle and mortar were used to obtain a fine powder, which was then washed. To eliminate inorganic salts, a 1.0 M HCl solution was used and sonicated for 10 min. Deionized water was added after that until it reached a neutral pH. After that, the product was dried at 80 °C. 2.4 Synthesze of (Ni/Cu/N) Mof, and (G-graphite) composite The obtained (Ni/Cu/N) MOF powder and G-graphite were mixed with different ratios (1:1,1:2: and 2:1) respectively in 15 ml DMF solution with magnetically stirred for 30 min. The solution was transferred into a stainless 200 ML Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 140 °C for 16 h. The collected materials were washed with DMF, and ethanol and then dried at 80 °C FOR 10 h. 2.5 Instrumental and measurement An X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, Empyrean, Netherlands) equipped with Cu Kα radiation of wavelength (1.54045 Ao) working at a voltage of 40 kV and an operational current of 30 mA was used to perform the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded in the 400–4000 cm−1 wavenumber range using a Vertex 70 (Bruker, Germany) instrument to determine the presence of the desired functional groups. The surface morphologies of the materials were described using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS, Sigma 500 VP). Using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, the textural properties of the sample, such as its surface areas and pore-size distributions, were examined and evaluated using a Tri-Star II 3020 (Micromeritics, USA) analyzer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) has been done by (Thermal gravimetric analyzer, SENSYS evo TG-DSC). 2.6 Fabrication of the working electrode Typically, 2.0 mg from each sample was dispersed into 380 μL of isopropanol/water (1/2) containing 10 μL of (5.0 wt% Nafion) solution and sonicated for 30 min to produce a homogenous ink solution. Then, 20 μL from that ink solution was drop cast onto the graphite sheet with (thickness: 1 mm) and area of (1 × 1 cm2) and dried at 60 °C. 2.7 Electrochemical analysis Using NOVA 1.11 software and a potentiate/galvanostatic (AUTOLAB PGSTAT 302 N, Metrohm, Switzerland), the electrochemical measurements were recorded. At ambient temperatures, a typical glass electrochemical cell with three electrodes was used. (Ag/AgCl) utilized as the reference electrode, the Platinum sheet electrode used as the counter electrode, and The active material-supported graphite paper served as the working electrode. Assessing the electro-catalytic activity of the produced electrodes was done with and without varying the content of methanol, using a 0.5 M NaOH solution employed as an electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted within a potential window from (0.0–0.6) V, with scanning rates ranging from (10-100) mV∙s−1. The (CA) chronoamperometry have been carried out at 0.6 V for 3600 s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the frequency range of 100 KHz to 0.01 Hz, measuring at (0.0, 0.6, and OCP) V with an amplitude of 10 mV.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Ni/Cu/N MOF", "Syns_method": "solvothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ni(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "0.5 mmol"}, "prc2": {"name": "Cu(NO3)2·3H2O", "amount": "0.5 mmol"}, "prc3": {"name": "BDC", "amount": "0.5 mmol"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMF", "amount": "30 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent1": {"reagent": "urea", "amount": "0.6 g", "ph": "6"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "centrifuge"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "70 °C", "time": "12 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "G-graphite", "Syns_method": "thermal decomposition", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "palm pollen grains", "amount": "not specified"}}, "process_parameters": {"temperature": "800 °C", "time": "1 h", "heating_rate": "3 °C/min"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "grind"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "wash", "substance": [{"name": "HCl", "amount": "1.0 M"}], "parameters": {"time": "10 min"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "Ni/Cu/N MOF-G-graphite composite", "Syns_method": "solvothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ni/Cu/N MOF", "amount": "1"}, "prc2": {"name": "G-graphite", "amount": "1"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMF", "amount": "15 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "140 °C", "time": "16 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "10 h"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Anode-free lithium batteries offer an excellent pathway to achieving a dramatic boost in energy density over current lithium-ion technology by eliminating the anode intercalation material during cell assembly. However, cycle stability remains a critical issue given that the inherent negative electrode capacity to positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) of ∼1 magnifies the performance effects of any coulombic inefficiencies in the lithium deposition/dissolution processes. Ionic liquid electrolytes have a demonstrated ability to support lithium metal cycling in lithium metal batteries through achieving high coulombic efficiencies. In this work, the phosphonium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide super-concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (3.2 mol kg−1) was cycled with high loading cathodes at 50 °C, representing the first report of an ionic liquid electrolyte being incorporated into an anode-free lithium battery. Li‖Cu half-cells yield a high coulombic efficiency of 99.4% with 100% excess lithium at 1 mA cm−2. The significance of substrate preparation was shown by performing a simple micro-patterning of the copper current collector which increased the capacity retention by 47.3% compared to cycling on plain copper foil in LFP‖Cu cells. The lithium deposits initially exhibited a columnar structure but gradually lost this preferred morphology due to the growth of a dead lithium network during cycling. Single crystal NMC 622 (4.6 mA h cm−2) cathodes were cycled in an anode-free full cell configuration to yield an average coulombic efficiency of 99.4% with 53% capacity retention after 100 cycles. These cells delivered an initial stack specific energy approaching 600 W h kg−1; over double that of current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, at both high charge and discharge current density (1.75 mA cm−2).

The XRD (X-ray diffraction measurement) was operated by using the Philips's diffractometer (Cu/Kα radiation, 2theta = 3–70°, λ = 1.54 A°). The FE-SEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope) was recorded by TESCAN MIRA3 apparatus. The Nitrogen ads-des isotherm was obtained using a BELSORP-mini II instrument at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). Degassing process for all synthesized samples was done at 100 °C. The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) equations were applied to sorption data using BELSORP analysis software to calculate the physical properties of materials such as the specific surface area (SSA), pore diameter, pore volume, and pore size distribution. Scattering electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed on a Hitachi S-4160 operated at 30 kV. The Raman spectroscopy was evaluated by Raman shift was recorded with the TEKSAN N1–541 instruments (Nd: YAG laser source, λ = 532 nm and 0.7 Mw power). The FT-IR spectra were recorded by using KBr disks on a RAYLEIGH WQF-510A FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 600–4000 cm−1. 2.1.1 Preparation of g-C3N4 In the first step, the g-C3N4 was prepared based on the reported literatures through the simple calcination process [40]. In brief, the appropriate amount of urea was transferred into the covered crucible, heated from ambient temperature to 550 °C (rate: 5 °C.min-1-) and retained at 550 °C for 4 h. The pale-yellow g-C3N4 was gained after reaching to the room temperature. 2.1.2 Preparation of g-C3N4/Uio-66 The g-C3N4/Uio-66 was prepared through the facile in situ solvothermal procedure. Typically, g-C3N4 (0.5 g) was dispersed in DMF (10 mL) under ultrasonic irradiation (denoted as A solution). Additionally, the B solution was synthesized by dissolving of ZrCl4 (0.22 mmol, 0.053 g) and TPA (0.2 mmol, 0.034 g) in DMF (10 mL) under stirring. Subsequently, B solution was gradually added into the A solution and dispersed by ultrasonic treatment. After half an hour, the solution was transferred into the stainless Teflon reactor and heated at 120 °C for 24 h. By reaching into the ambient temperature, the mixture was centrifuged and the solid product (g-C3N4/Uio-66) was collected, washed with DMF and dried. 2.1.3 Preparation of Zr@NC-T The Zr@NC-T (T: pyrolyzed Temperature) was synthesized by pyrolysis of g-C3N4/Uio-66 composite in the programmed laboratory furnace at different temperatures: 700, 800, and 900 °C, for 120 min (R = 5 °C.min−1). The obtained black powder was remarked as Zr@NC-700, Zr@NC-800, and Zr@NC-900, respectively. 2.1.4 Catalytic proficiency The catalytic oxidation of BnOH was performed as follow: BnOH (1 mmol), Zr@NC-700 (15 mg) was mixed in H2O (5 mL) as the solvent and allowed to stirred at room temperature. The progress of the oxidation reaction was checked by Thine Layered Chromatography (TLC) technique. At the end of the reaction, the Zr@NC-700 was separated from the reaction mixture, washed with EtOH, dried and recovered for the next same catalytic runs. Besides, the mixture of the reaction was extracted with CH2Cl2 and analyzed with GC–MS. 2.1.5 Recyclability test At the end of each catalytic process, the Zr@NC-700 was collected, treated with EtOH, dried, and reused for the next oxidation reaction.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods All chemicals used here were analytical grade (Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher) unless otherwise specified. Aqueous stock solutions of chromium, lead, fluoride, and methylene blue were prepared in deionized water and pH of these solutions were adjusted using 1 M, 0.1 M, and 0.01 M NaOH or HCl and measured using a pH meter (Hanna HI 2211). 2.1 Preparation of Fe2TiO5/BC and Fe2TiO5 Fe2TiO5/BC was synthesized by modifying a previously reported hydrothermal method to prepare the specific binary oxide Fe2TiO5 [39]. Briefly, titanium(IV) oxyacetylacetonate (TiO(acac)2) (7.5 mmol, 2.18 g), ferric chloride (FeCl3) (15 mmol, 2.97 g), and urea (NH2CONH2) (37.5 mmol, 2.25 g) were dissolved in deionized water (250 mL) and mixed with Douglas fir biochar (20 g). This biochar (BC) is a byproduct from timber industry wood gasification. It has previously been produced by gasifying green wood chips at 900–1000 ℃ in an updraft gasifier for a 1–10 s residence time in a nitrogen atmosphere. This BC was previously water washed to remove soluble organic residues and dried at room temperature [40]. The BC particle size obtained by sieving was in the range of 0.1–0.5 mm. The pH of the TiO(acac)2/FeCl3/urea/BC slurry was adjusted to 8 using ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and further stirred at 80 ℃ for 48 h. Fe2TiO5 particles then nucleate, grow and deposit on BC. Some of the nucleation and particle growth might occur at the BC surface in addition to those in the aqueous phase. This is the only difference from the literature preparation of the neat Fe2TiO5 [39]. The BC was vacuum filtered from the mixture and washed three times with deionized water and followed by ethanol. Then the solid powder was dried at 60 ℃ for 2 h in a vacuum oven at 1 atm and finally calcinated at 500 ℃ in a furnace under nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h. The resulting material (19.10 g) is referred to as Fe2TiO5/BC. This contained about 13.4 % wt. of Fe2TiO5, calculated from ash content differences of DFBC and Fe2TiO5/BC (see section 3.1). Neat Fe2TiO5 was synthesized for characterization studies following the above-mentioned procedure but without the addition of biochar. (TiO(acac)2) (7.5 mmol, 2.18 g), (FeCl3) (15 mmol, 2.97 g), and urea (NH2CONH2) (37.5 mmol, 2.25 g) were dissolved in deionized water (250 mL). This gave 1.54 g (∼85% yield) of Fe2TiO5 Scheme 1 2.2 Characterization of Fe2TiO5/BC and Fe2TiO5 Surface morphology of Fe2TiO5/BC was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL JSM-6500F), at 5 kV coupled to an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector. Transmission electron microscopy images were obtained by a TEM (JEOL model 2100), operated at 200 kV with an Oxford X-max-80 detector for the TEM/EDX analyses. X-ray diffraction analysis was performed using a Rigaku ultima III (Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54 Å). Diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectroscopy was used to acquire the Fe2TiO5/BC band gap estimation. Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume and pore diameter were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms using a Micrometrics Tristar II Plus 3030 surface area analyzer at 277 K. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min from 20 to 1000 ℃ under nitrogen atmosphere using a Mettler TGA/DSC thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA/DSC STARe system, Mettler Toledo, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements before and after Cr(VI), Pb(II), F- and MB adsorption on Fe2TiO5/BC were conducted with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha system (1486.6 eV, Al Kα line, 400 µm2 spot size with a maximum penetration depth of 100 Å). CHNS organic elemental analyzer (UNICUBE-Elementar) was used to get the weight percent C, H, and N in Fe2TiO5/BC. Ash content of Fe2TiO5/BC was calculated by incinerating 1 g of sample in an open top porcelain crucible in a muffle furnace at 650 ℃ for 4 h and then comparing the initial and final masses. Fe and Ti wt.% of the material were determined by an acid digestion method. (50 mL of (1:3 v/v 70% HNO3 : 37% HCl) mixed with composite (0.1 g) at 60 ℃ for 12 h prior to the analysis). This was followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Point of zero charge (PZC) of Fe2TiO5/BC was determined by a plot of equilibrium pH vs. initial pH. NaCl (0.01 M) solutions (50 mL) at different pH values were (2 to 10) prepared and mixed with Fe2TiO5/BC (0.05 g) for 24 h. 2.3 Batch adsorption, effect of competitive ions on adsorption, iron leaching and photodegradation studies Equilibrium adsorption studies of Cr(VI), Pb(II), fluoride and methylene blue (MB) on Fe2TiO5/BC were performed to investigate the effect of solution pH, contact time and adsorbate concentration. The effect of pH on adsorption was examined using three replicates at each pH from 2 to 10 in 25 mL solutions containing 50 mg/L of analyte and (25 mg) Fe2TiO5/BC doses. The effect of contact time was monitored by varying the equilibrium time for each analyte. Different adsorbate concentrations were used for batch sorption studies and plastic vials (50 mL) were used to mix all samples (25 mL) with Fe2TiO5/BC. Solutions were filtered (Whatman filter paper No. 1) after reaching equilibrium. The remaining concentrations of Cr(VI), Pb(II) were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) (Shimadzu AA-7000). Fluoride was determined using a fluoride ion selective electrode and methylene blue (MB) by double beam UV–Vis spectroscopy at 664 nm. Standard deviations for three replicates were used to calculate error. Adsorption capacity for each analyte at equilibrium, Qe (mg/g) was obtained from Q e = ( C i - C e ) V W . Here, Ci and Ce denote the initial and equilibrium concentration of chromium or nitrate in mg/L, V is the volume of adsorbate in L, and W is the weight of biochar in g. Cr(VI), Pb(II), fluoride and MB adsorption onto Fe2TiO5/BC in the presence of sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, chloride, carbonate, arsenate, molybdate and Cu(II) competitive ions were investigated since these ions are present in natural and waste water systems in trace or comparatively high amounts. The effect of each competitive ion was monitored at 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mM at room temperature for Cr(VI), 50 mg/L, Pb(II) 100 mg/L, fluoride 50 mg/L and MB 100 mg/L, respectively. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Fe2TiO5/BC (25 mg) was mixed with 25 mL of solution containing the competitive ion for 3 h with Cr(VI), Pb(II) 1 h, fluoride 2 h and MB 2 h, respectively. After reaching equilibrium, the mixtures were filtered, and the adsorbate concentration of each was determined. Also, the remaining competitive ion concentrations after adsorption in each mixture were quantified using ICP-MS (for arsenate, phosphate, molybdate and copper), ion selective electrode (for chloride) and liquid chromatography (LC-UV) (for nitrate). Simultaneous Cr(VI), Pb(II), fluoride and MB removal capability and Fe2TiO5BC’s performance in complex water matrices were tested by simulating a mixture of 10 mg/L of each species in different matrices (DI water, Chadwick lake water, Noxubee lake water, Latin American water (Altamirano, Buenos Aires, Argentina)). However, co-existing Pb(II) and Cr(VI) precipitates were removed by filtration prior to the sorption experiments. Then the pH was immediately adjusted to 6. (At pH 6 the remaining Pb(II) and CrO4 2- concentrations in the solution are ∼0.65 and ∼0.37 ppm, respectively). At the experimental pH of 6, PbCrO4’s conditional product (Ksp1) is approximately 10-11 M2, resulting in 10-5.5 M Pb(II) (0.65 ppm) and CrO4 2- (0.37 ppm) at equilibrium. Because these concentrations are low at equilibrium, the precipitation equilibria are unlikely to be restored. To form a precipitate, the ionic product (Q) must be > Ksp1. Removal % was used as a figure of merit for the comparison of sorption performance. Approximately 50.0 mg of Fe2TiO5/BC was equilibrated (in triplicate, 2 h) with 25.0 mL of the multi-species pollutant solutions. These suspensions were filtered and filtrate were analyzed for the remaining species concentrations using ICP-MS (Cr(VI), Pb(II)), ISE (F-) and LC-UV (MB) (See supporting information). Iron leaching experiments were conducted on Fe2TiO5/BC (25 mg) after adsorption of Cr(VI), 50 mg/L, Pb(II) 100 mg/L, fluoride 50 mg/L and MB 100 mg/L (25 mL for each solution). These experiments were performed for each analyte at pH 3, 5, 7, and 9 at 25 ℃. Iron content in the filtrates after adsorption was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The photocatalytic degradation of MB induced by the Fe2TiO5/BC composite under different experimental conditions was monitored under UV (365 nm) light irradiation. Aqueous MB (100 mg/L, 100 mL) containing the Fe2TiO5/BC composite (100 mg) in a pyrex beaker (250 mL) was placed under a mercury spot lamp (100 W, wavelength 365 nm, UVP P/N 34–0054-01, Upland, USA), This lamp was placed 10 cm above the top level of the solution, which had a depth of 3 cm in the beaker). Photodegradation was conducted at an initial pH of either 6 or 3 for all experimental irradiations. Air or nitrogen was continuously bubbled through the aqueous MB solutions. Beakers containing MB and the photocatalyst run in the dark were covered with aluminum foil and magnetic stirred (100 rpm) for 2 h to achieve the adsorption equilibrium prior to the photodegradation studies. All experiments were performed in triplicate and standard deviation was used to calculate the error of each ion measurement.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Fe2TiO5/BC", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "TiO(acac)2", "amount": "2.18 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "FeCl3", "amount": "2.97 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "urea", "amount": "2.25 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "250 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent": "NH4OH", "ph": "8"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "48 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "2 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "calcinate", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Fe2TiO5", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "TiO(acac)2", "amount": "2.18 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "FeCl3", "amount": "2.97 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "urea", "amount": "2.25 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "250 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent": "NH4OH", "ph": "8"}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "48 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "2 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "calcinate", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "2 h"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Recently, the development of pillar-layered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is receiving more and more attention because of their pore surface chemistry tunability and designability. In this work, we firstly synthesized various sizes of high-quality Ni-LAP [Ni2(L-asp)2(pz)] (L-asp = l-aspartic acid, pz = pyrazine) crystals key for secondary growth by manipulating the crystal thermal dynamics and kinetics of Ni-LAP synthesis solution simply through choosing the Ni(OAc)2 as metal source and pretreatment at 40 °C, followed by the fabrication of defect-free Ni-LAP membranes as a model in a short time of 4 h using the linker salt method. It is found the pretreatment of Ni(OAc)2 precursor solution at 40 °C with continuous stirring for 6 h can effectively promote deprotonation to form 250 nm crystals. The linker salt method enables a greener and more rapid synthesis of Ni-LAP membranes, with continuous and compact Ni-LAP membranes, where soluble metal precursors and organic linking salts provide the synthesis solution a higher degree of supersaturation, both of which play an important role in the rapid preparation of Ni-LAP membranes. The preparation parameters of the Ni-LAP membranes were investigated in detail, and the results from the Ni-LAP membrane gas separation performance showed that the preferential (111) orientation membrane (M9) exhibited the best H2/CO2 separation performance with separation factor of 23.8 and H2 permeance of 2.11 × 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 compared to the preferential (002) orientations (M3), which may attributed to the preferential (111) orientation being at an angle to the optimal a-axis aperture perpendicular to the support thereby reducing the mass transfer resistance. Furthermore, the generation of corrosive nitric acid during the preparation process can be greatly reduced and replaced by eco-friendly potassium nitrate. The superiority of the pore structure and the remarkable stability of these MOF membranes show the potential for H2 purification.

The synthesis of UiO-66-NH2 was performed following the procedure outlined in the literature (Lu et al., 2021). To prepare the UiO-66-NH2/PAN NFMs, PAN and polyethene glycol (PEG) were dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at a mass ratio of 1:1 to obtain a solution with a solute concentration of 20 %. Subsequently, specific amounts of UiO-66-NH2 (with contents of 1 %, 3 %, and 5 % relative to the solution) were added to the solution and thoroughly mixed. Ultrasonic treatment was used to remove the air bubbles. The UiO-66-NH2/PAN membranes (1 %, 3 %, and 5 % UiO-66-NH2/PAN) were then fabricated using an electrospinning machine (see Section 2 of the SI for specific parameters). Finally, the UiO-66-NH2/PAN membranes were rinsed with deionised water to remove the PEG and prepare them for subsequent experiments. UiO-66-Lys/PAN was synthesised as follows: Glutaraldehyde (GA) and UiO-66-NH2/PAN were mixed with ethanol (120 mL) at a molar ratio of 1:1. The mixture underwent a reaction at 70 °C for 6 h, resulting in the formation of aldehyde-modified nanofibre materials as intermediates. Subsequently, Lys was added and the reaction was continued for an additional 6 h. Upon completion of the reaction, the resulting product, UiO-66-Lys/PAN, was thoroughly washed with deionised water and dried to obtain the final product. 2.3 Adsorption experiments Adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the capacity of the membrane materials to adsorb cobalt ions. An absorbent (30 mg) was added to 50 mL of cobalt ion solution in a 250 mL conical flask to carry out the adsorption tests for Co(II) on the membrane. The flask was then placed inside an oscillating incubator and rotated at 150 rpm. This study examined how the adsorption process is affected by pH, initial concentration of cobalt ions, contact time, and temperature. An ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentration of Co(II). The calculation of the adsorption capacity (q e , mg/g) of Co(II) was calculated using Eq. S1 (Chen et al., 2020). 2.4 Membrane performance test The permeability and rejection of the NFMs in pure water were evaluated using a cross-flow filtration (CFF) system with an effective membrane diameter of 5.3 cm. To maintain a consistent permeation flux (PF), the membranes were thoroughly wetted and permeated with deionised water for 60 min at a pressure of 1 bar. Subsequently, the experiment was repeated under identical pressure conditions for an additional 15 min, and the pure water flux (PWF, L·m−2·h−1) of the membranes was determined using Eq. S2 (Fang et al., 2020). For the filtration of a 20 mg/L cobalt ion solution, the CFF system was operated at a pressure of 1 bar for 180 min, with periodic collection of the osmotic fluid every 20 min. The rejection, which was determined by analysing the cobalt ion concentration, was calculated using Eq. S3 (Zhang et al., 2021a). 2.5 Irradiation experiment The radiation source utilised in this research was a 60Co γ-ray irradiation facility, provided by the Sichuan Institute of Atomic Energy (SIAE). The UiO-66-Lys/PAN was exposed to doses of 60Co γ-ray irradiation ranging from 20 to 200 kGy. Subsequently, XRD analysis was conducted to examine the crystal structures of the NFMs before and after exposure to γ-rays.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Abstract\nDue to the increase of environmental pollution by various industries in recent decades, preparing drinking water has become one of the most vital issues for many countries. The organic pollutant, such as different azo dyes, is one of the most important issues. Using photocatalyst materials is considered to be an optimal solution to prevent environmental pollution. In this work, novel ternary catalysts of CoFe2O4/TiO2/Au were synthesized for the photocatalytic reduction of methyl orange (MO) under UV light illumination. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property of Au nanoparticles is widely exploited for their photocatalytic activities. In this research, both CoFe2O4 and TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by sol–gel method. Hydrothermal treatment was also used to synthesize the nanocomposite. Au nanoparticles were successfully loaded on the CoFe2O4/TiO2 surface to get CoFe2O4/TiO2/Au magnetic nanocomposites. To characterize the shape of the structure, morphology, purity, and particle size of the nanocomposite, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Zeta potential analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy were employed. Alternating gradient field magnetometer (AGFM) studies show the superparamagnetic properties of the CoFe2O4 nanostructures. Finally, we investigated the catalytic performance and recyclability in reducing MO of synthesized nanocomposites by monitoring a UV–visible spectrophotometer. The composite catalysts can then be easily separated from the reaction solution using a magnet bar and ultimately reused. We used artificial neural network (ANN) to remove expensive experimental research and tried solving and predicting the novel phenomena with huge factors. Initially, information about the degradation of MO was gathered by experimental analyses. We then tried shaping and calculating the special algorithm that could find the best relation and high percentage of accuracy between input variables. The genetic algorithm as one of the most popular algorithms in an artificial world was selected to predict and train the model. In conclusion, the experimental results determined that the CoFe2O4/TiO2/Au magnetic nanocomposites were successfully synthesized and it exhibited a useful effect on the removal of azo dyes from the contaminated solutions.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "To model the effect of plasma-induced surface charge on catalytic surfaces, we used single-metal-atom and metal-cluster models, as reported in ref. 23 and 24. The DFT calculations that describe surface charge effects on adsorption energies for single metal atoms and the corresponding free atom atomic forces are performed using CP2K.24,42 Briefly, these calculations make use of the Quickstep module of the CP2K code. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the DFT calculations, which are performed for a γ-Al2O3(110) surface (6 aluminum layers with 2 × 2 anhydrous super cell), as derived from ref. 45. The hydrous 110 surface is the most stable surface termination for γ-Al2O3. However, it has been shown that the surface charge effect can be effectively modelled using an anhydrous surface.23 Hence, to reduce computational complexity, we employ an anhydrous γ-Al2O3(110) supercell in the DFT calculations performed in this work. The Quickstep module uses the combined Gaussian and plane wave method to calculate system energies. The exchange and correlation is calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)46 functional supplemented by D3 dispersion correction.47 The DFT calculations use GTH pseudopotentials with a polarized double-ζ (m-DZVP) basis set. Considering the size of the system geometry, the calculations are performed at Γ-point only. To account for the effects of surface charge, a proton is introduced in the simulation cell by defining an H atom type without a basis set, preventing electron assignment. The proton is fixed at a Z-height of 40 Å, while forcing the entire system to be charge neutral. Hence, this proton introduces a negative charge on the surface. This counter-ion or proton position is chosen to minimize the effects of electric field generated by the charge-countercharge system. The charge-countercharge interactions become negligible if the countercharge is placed at a Z-height of more than 30 Å. However, to be on the conservative side and to further isolate the effect of surface charge, we decided to place the counter-ion 40 Å away from the surface. This countercharge introduces a negative charge on the surface. The simulation cell is treated non-periodically in the z-direction using Martyna–Tuckerman Poisson solver.48,49 The convergence and accuracy of the calculations are examined in relation to parameters such as the location of counter-ion, choice of functional, and energy cut-off; see ref. 24 for further details. We use a single positive counter-ion in our calculations, resulting in a surface charge density of 0.06 C m−2. This is considered to be within the range of plasma-induced surface charge, as measured experimentally50 and reported in modeling studies.51 We note that this method can be easily adopted to account for different surface charge densities in a plasma catalytic process.\nTo account for the surface charge effects on the adsorption of different NxHy species on different catalysts, a set of single metal atoms and metal clusters are first adsorbed on the γ-Al2O3 surface. Then, the adsorption energies of the different adsorbates are calculated by:Eads = Eslab+adsorbate − Eslab − Eadsorbate in the presence and absence of the surface charge. γ-Al2O3 offers 7 unique adsorption sites, including 2 or 3 coordinated O atom sites and 3 or 4 coordinated Al atom sites. All these adsorption sites are explored for the single metal atoms. For metal clusters, they are first energy minimized without the support and then adsorbed on the γ-Al2O3 support. Although more realistic, direct surface adsorption calculations on metal-cluster models (metal clusters adsorbed on the γ-Al2O3(110) surface) are configuration dependent. That is, the size and shape of the metal clusters can impact the extent of the surface charge effect. Single-metal-atom models, on the other hand, provide a more consistent way to compare the effect of surface charge on different catalysts due to their relative configurational independence.\nWe consider 11 single metal atoms, namely Ag, Au, Cu, Re, Ru, Co, Ni, Pd, Fe, Pt and Rh, using the single metal atom model, where the last three metals are only used for testing the generalization performance of the fine-tuned model for the single metal atoms. We consider the adsorption of seven different adsorbates, namely N, N2, H, H2, NH, NH2, and NH3, which are involved in NH3 synthesis. DFT calculations are also performed for metal clusters of Ru and Pt on the γ-Al2O3 surface. To ensure that the sensitivity of the adsorbates to surface structures is considered, we calculated the adsorption energies for all adsorbates on the seven unique adsorption sites offered by the γ-Al2O3(110) support, as well as their co-adsorption on the support and metal atom combined. Our analysis showed that adsorption on the metal atom/cluster was always favored for the adsorbates investigated in this work. Additional details about the DFT calculations performed in this work can be found in ref. 23 and 24.\nFor each pairing of the eleven single metal atoms with the seven distinct adsorbates, the complete geometry relaxations are treated as individual data points. That is, for example, given the combination of H + Au + γ-Al2O3, if achieving the final relaxed structure involved creating 100 profiles during the geometry relaxation, these 100 profiles would be counted as 100 separate data points. Since only CP2K is used in this work to generate data, to account for the discrepancies stemming from using VASP software to generate the OC20 dataset for thermal catalysis28 and CP2K software, the above-described DFT calculations are performed both in the presence and absence of the surface charge. Consequently, a dataset of 5164 data points is compiled for Ag, Au, Cu, Re, Ru, Co, Ni, and Pd, whereas the independent datasets for Fe, Rh, and Pt include 472, 435, and 587 data points, respectively. The former dataset is then divided into training, validation, and test sets in the ratio of 70/20/10%. The data labels consist of the adsorption energy and atomic forces for each individual atom.\nA similar data structure is also used for Pt and Ru metal clusters on γ-Al2O3, yielding datasets of 3965 and 3627 data points for Pt and Ru clusters, respectively. The Pt cluster dataset is further divided into training, validation, and test sets using the same ratio as above to aid in model fine-tuning. The Ru cluster dataset is only utilized for testing the generalization performance of the fine-tuned model for the metal clusters.\nIn this work, we utilize two GNNs from the Open Catalyst Project, i.e., pre-trained using the OC20 dataset,28 to enable transfer learning from thermal to plasma catalysis. The two models are an EquiformerV2 model using the attention mechanism and a GemNet-dT model popular in thermal catalysis. These architectures are depicted in Fig. 2. The EquiformerV2 model first converts atoms to their corresponding embeddings according to their atomic number. The geometric information among atoms, such as atom–atom distance, is encoded into the embeddings that are vectors with the same dimensions as the atom embeddings. These two embeddings are then summed up and fed into an arbitrary number of Equiformer blocks. Within each Equiformer block, new learnable atom embeddings are defined to further learn the atom–atom edge geometric information. Along with this geometric information, the fed embedding of each atom is updated according to the embeddings of its N closest neighbors within each Equiformer block. Here, attention scores are learned that weigh the contribution of the N surrounding atoms. Therefore, the attention scores provide a degree of interpretability as they reveal the interactions between atoms. EquiformerV2 also uses a multi-head attention mechanism, where each head has its own attention score to capture different aspects of relationships between atoms; see ref. 40 for further details on the attention scores of EquiformerV2, which are different from classical attention scores as in ref. 36. The outputs of the final Equiformer block are fed into a force and an energy block to predict the atomic force for each atom in xyz directions and the structure adsorption energy. The force block is a graph attention layer, which is also a structure used in the Equiformer blocks. The energy block is a feedforward layer. Here, we choose the lightest pre-trained EquiformerV2 model with eight Equiformer blocks based on OC20,28,40 since it demonstrated a sufficiently good performance for the transfer learning task at hand. This model considers N = 20 closest neighbors for each atom in each attention head, and uses eight-head attention in each Equiformer and force block. This EquiformerV2 model is used in all three transfer learning tasks of this work, as detailed in the next section.\nThe construction of the initial part of the GemNet-dT model is similar to that of EquiformerV2, with the geometric information extracted and atoms converted into embeddings. Then, graph interaction blocks update these embeddings according to the geometric information. In the original GemNet-dT model without an adaptor, each interaction block, as well as the initial embedding are followed by a feedforward block. The outputs of these feedforward blocks are added to predict the adsorption energy and atomic forces. In this work, however, we use a modified GemNet-dT model that utilizes a multi-head attention adaptor to balance information from the intermediate graph-based blocks for improved transfer learning.32 In the modified GemNet-dT model, the feedforward layers in the interaction blocks are removed and, instead, a weighted summation is performed in the adaptor to make predictions. To further enhance transfer learning ability, additional interaction blocks with feedforward layers are introduced.32 The outputs of these interaction blocks are directly added to the output from the multi-head attention adaptor, yielding the adsorption energy and atomic force predictions. In the modified GemNet-dT model, the parameters of the adaptor, the additional interaction blocks and their feedforward layers must be trained, whereas other parts of the model are based on the pre-trained GemNet-dt model of OC20 with three interaction blocks. We note that the modified GemNet-dT model is only used in the dual-model framework of the task “interpretation of surface charge effects” to capture discrepancies between the thermal catalysis and plasma catalysis datasets other than the surface charge effects.§\nIn this work, we investigate three different tasks to demonstrate the usefulness of transfer learning from thermal catalysis to plasma catalysis. In the first task, we focus on assessing the prediction accuracy and generalizability of fine-tuned models for the case of single metal atoms. In the second task, we use attention-based transfer learning to provide interpretable insights into the effects of surface charge in plasma catalysis. In the third task, we investigate transfer learning from single atoms to metal clusters.\nIn this transfer learning task, we use the pre-trained EquiformerV2 model introduced in the Pre-trained models from thermal catalysis section, due to its superior performance on the OC20 dataset. Several adaptations to the original EquiformerV2 model architecture are made for the transfer learning task at hand. An example of the structurally adapted EquiformerV2 model is shown in Fig. 3, where only the middle three Equiformer blocks B6–8 and all the proton embeddings are unfrozen during transfer learning. In the geometric information, B1 to B8 and force blocks of the adapted model, each atom is impacted by its 20 closest neighbors and the proton.\nThese adaptations are made out of several considerations. First, proton is placed far away from all atoms, whereas the impact of proton may be appreciable on all atoms. Therefore, since the EquiformerV2 model only considers the nearest 20 atoms for each atom, the model is adapted to also account for the effects of the proton. Furthermore, atom embeddings remain constant during transfer learning. This is because the updated embeddings may affect the attention blocks of the EquiformerV2 model adversely, potentially hindering the extrapolation capability on unseen atoms. Earlier layers of the pre-trained model tend to capture structural knowledge, such as edge between atoms and rotational equivalence of the catalyst structure.32,40 Therefore, freezing these layers can also be beneficial to the extrapolation capability of the fine-tuned model. However, the number of initial layers to be frozen can have a significant influence on the model performance. Thus, we investigate the impact of freezing different numbers of initial layers of the pre-trained model on the extrapolation capability of the fine-tuned model. Additionally, freezing of the output energy and force blocks is also tested since these blocks are responsible for projecting the outputs from the eight Equiformer block (B8) to the energy and force predictions. As for learning the proton embeddings, they are initialized using the hydrogen embeddings from the pre-trained EquiformerV2 model and their parameters are updated during transfer learning. In theory, hydrogen embeddings represent the closest approximation to that of protons. Table 1 summarizes all the adaptations of the pre-trained EquiformerV2 model used for transfer learning from thermal to plasma catalysis. An ablation study is performed to test the performance of these models.\nThere are several discrepancies between the OC20 data used for learning the pre-trained EquiformerV2 model and the plasma catalysis DFT data used for fine-tuning the model. These include differences in DFT calculations made by VASP and CP2K for generating thermal and plasma catalysis data, respectively, the catalyst–adsorbate configurations shifting from metal clusters plus adsorbates in the OC20 dataset to single metal atoms plus adsorbate with support in the plasma catalysis dataset, the overall atom count, and the introduction of surface charge by protons. While using the above-described fine-tuned EquiformerV2 models can enable satisfactory transfer learning outcomes, including good test and extrapolation scores, extracting meaningful insights from the attention mechanism of the Equiformer blocks, such as B6–B8 in Fig. 3, can be infeasible since they cannot delineate the above discrepancies. This is because the attention scores, which capture the impact of the 20 closest atoms and proton on any atom, are updated based on the plasma catalysis DFT data, making discerning the surface charge effects from other differences impossible.\nTo elucidate the role of surface charge, we propose a dual-model architecture that isolates the effects of proton-induced surface charges in the EquiformerV2 model. Meanwhile, to ensure that all other discrepancies are effectively captured, we employ the GemNet-dT + A architecture, as proposed in ref. 32, which has demonstrated strong transfer learning capabilities for out-of-domain tasks. As shown in Fig. 4, the proposed architecture consists of two pre-trained models operating concurrently: the GemNet-dT + A model that is fine-tuned using single metal atom data of CP2K when proton is removed, and the EquiformerV2 model fine-tuned with CP2K data with the proton effects accounted for. For fine-tuning of the GemNet-dT + A model using single metal atom data of CP2K, proton is removed before a single metal atom structure is fed to the model. This allows the fine-tuned GemNet-dT + A model to learn the discrepancies between the pre-trained model using the OC20 thermal catalysis data and the CP2K data generated in this work. This is while a single metal atom structure with proton is fed to the EquiformerV2 model, serving as a corrector to predictions of the fine-tuned GemNet-dT + A model by accounting for surface charge effects. This way the dual-model architecture can delineate the role of surface charge from other discrepancies between the thermal and plasma catalysis data. The combined outputs of the two models yield the predictions for adsorption energy and atomic forces. To train the models, the following loss functions are devised. For single metal atom structures with proton, the loss function Jplasma is defined as in eqn (1), whereas for structures without proton, the loss function Jthermal takes the form of eqn (2), i.e.,(1)(2) Here, E denotes the actual adsorption energy, while Êa and Êb represent the energy predictions from the GemNet-dT + A and EquiformerV2 models, respectively. A stands for the total number of free atoms in the structure, and j,x,a, j,x,b (similarly for y and z directions) are the atomic force predictions from the GemNet-dT + A and EquiformerV2 models, respectively. The coefficients α and β trade off the loss contributions from the energy and atomic force predictions, with values of α = 4 and β = 100 used in this work, as in ref. 28.\nTo fine-tune the GemNet-dT + A model, the initial atom embeddings and the existing interaction blocks in the pre-trained model are frozen. One additional interaction block is added and the number of heads in the multi-head attention adaptor is set as five, as in ref. 32. Since these newly added layers are not pre-trained, they are initialized randomly. For the EquiformerV2 model, we utilize the model architecture outlined in Fig. 3. However, we only allow fine-tuning of proton embeddings and the 8th Equiformer block (B8),36,40 in the pre-trained EquiformerV2 model. Additionally, the output layers responsible for predicting energy and atomic forces remain unchanged during model fine-tuning. This is based on the consideration that each Equiformer block within the pre-trained EquiformerV2 model has its own atom embeddings. Allowing all Equiformer blocks to adapt during model fine-tuning could disperse the surface charge effects across various blocks, rendering the predictions uninterpretable.\nIn this task, we look to investigate if the pre-trained models for single metal atoms can be effectively fine-tuned for metal clusters. To this end, we use the single metal atom data for all the above-mentioned metals and the metal cluster data of Pt, leaving the Ru cluster data for testing the generalization performance of the model. Note that we avoid any potential bias caused due to excluding the single metal atom data for Pt in model refinement; for example, as a result of missing the connections between Pt and other metals, and the link between single Pt and Pt cluster systems. In this task, we use the same pre-trained EquiformerV2 model as in task 1. The choice of which blocks of the pre-trained model to freeze is made based on the best performing models of task 1 in terms of both test accuracy and generalization performance. We investigated three strategies for transfer learning, as summarized in Table 2. The first strategy involves using the metal cluster data for fine-tuning of the pre-trained model. The second strategy further fine-tunes the transfer learning model of task 1 using metal cluster data, whereas the third strategy uses the mixture of single metal atom and metal cluster data to fine-tune the pre-trained model. For all three strategies, we maintain a training-validation-test ratio of 70/20/10%.\n", "output": {}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental techniques\nPreparation of PVA:SA:TiO2 nanocomposite films\nFirstly, TiO2 NPs were synthesized in a previous work34 by green route using extract of Aloe vera and TiCL4 as a precursor. Briefly, 100 ml of extract from Aloe vera leaves was gradually added to a 100 ml 1.0 N TiCL4 solution in deionized water under constant stirring. The mixture's pH was adjusted at 7 and stirring was maintained at room temperature for 4 h. After being filtered and washed using double-distilled water, the formed nanoparticles were left to dry overnight at 100 °C. Finally, the obtained dry powder was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h.\nSecondly, in a previous study conducted by the authors, PVA:SA:TiO2 nanocomposite films were created utilizing a solvent-casting process35. In summary, a homogeneous solution was obtained by mixing and constantly stirring PVA and SA solutions (PVA: SA 3:1 w/w) for a duration of 6 h. After a short time of sonication, several suspensions of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with concentrations of 0 wt.%, 1 wt.%, 3 wt.%, and 5 wt.% by weight were added to the pre-prepared solution of PVA and SA. The suspensions were agitated for an extended period, after that transferred into Petri dishes, and left to evaporate.\nFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy\nThe chemical structure of the materials was determined using the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) technique, specifically employing the Shimadzu Prestige-21 Spectrophotometer. The FT-IR spectra were obtained in the wavenumber range from 4000 cm−1 to 600 cm−1.\nDifferential scanning calorimeter (DSC)\nThe thermal transition behavior was investigated using the differential scanning calorimeter model Shimadzu DSC-50 for all the nanocomposites. The measurement was conducted in a range from room temperature to 230 °C. The experiment used a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen environment.\nThermal gravimetric analysis (TGA)\nMettler Toledo TA-TGA was used to measure thermal stability by investigating the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The samples were heated from room temperature to 593 °C, under N2 atmosphere, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.\nDynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)\nNanocomposites were analyzed for their thermo-mechanical properties using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Triton Instruments were used to conduct the tests on the nanocomposites at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 Hz. The readings were analyzed in tension mode at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, from room temperature to 150 °C, by measuring the temperature dependence properties such as the loss and storage moduli and the loss factor (tan δ). The prepared samples were of 0.14 mm thickness.\nZeta potential analysis\nThe Zeta potential analysis of the nanocomposite films composed of PVA:SA:TiO2 was conducted using dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques with a Zeta sizer instrument manufactured by Malvern (obtained from the United Kingdom). The specimens were immersed in distilled water and subjected to sonication in a bath sonicator to achieve a uniform dispersion. Zeta potential measurements were conducted under ambient conditions at 25 °C and a detection angle of 90 degrees.\nSwelling and degradation studies\nPieces of a uniform weight were cut from the prepared nanocomposite films. Each sample was placed into a sterilized plastic container containing a phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution of pH 7.4 and incubated at 37 °C for different time intervals up to 14 days. The samples were removed from the incubating solution, surface wiped, and weighed to determine their wet weights (Ww) at the predetermined time (1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 14 days). They were then dried in an oven at a temperature of 40 °C for forty-eight hours until they reached a steady weight. Subsequently, the specimens were reweighed in order to ascertain their dry weights (Wd).\nThe swelling percentage was calculated using the following formula:\n$${\\text{DS}}\\% = \\frac{{{\\text{W}}_{{\\text{w}}} - {\\text{W}}_{{\\text{d}}} }}{{{\\text{W}}_{{\\text{d}}} }} \\times 100$$\n (1) \nDS denotes the swelling degree, whereas Ww and Wd provide the weights of the wet and dry film, respectively36. On the other hand, the weight loss percentage of the sample was recorded using the following equation37:\n$${\\text{Weight}}\\;{\\text{loss}}\\% = \\frac{{{\\text{W}}_{{\\text{i}}} - {\\text{W}}_{{\\text{d}}} }}{{{\\text{W}}_{{\\text{i}}} }} \\times 100$$\n (2) \nwhere Wi is the initial weight of each sample.\nBiological activity of the nanocomposites\nAntimicrobial activity using agar diffusion technique\nThe antibacterial activity of the materials was evaluated against five indicator microorganisms using the agar diffusion method38. Standard and clinically isolated microorganism strains were used such as Aspergillus Niger, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Escherichia coli. The tested organisms (106 colony-forming units/ml) were inoculated overnight in potato dextrose agar of yeast and fungi and nutrient agar media of bacteria, then poured promptly into sterile Petri dishes. Subsequently, samples were cut into small parts (1 × 1 cm2) and placed onto the agar plate surface. After 24-h incubation at the optimum growth temperatures for the inoculated plates, the diameter of the inhibition zone was measured in centimeters. In the present study, Streptomycin was used as standard antibacterial (positive control), while Fluconazole acted as standard anti-fungal. 10% (v/v) of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) acted as a negative control.\nDetermination of antimicrobial activity (MIC) using broth media\nThe antimicrobial activity of the four different membrane concentrations was assessed in vitro. The growth inhibition of pathogenic organisms was measured using standard and clinically isolated microorganism strains, such as Bacillus cereus (Gram-positive bacteria), Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria), Candida albicans (yeast), and Aspergillus Niger (fungi) and E. coli (Gram-negative bacteria)39. The samples were cut into small pieces (0.03 g) and put into tubes containing 10 mL of potato dextrose broth (fungi) or nutrient broth (bacteria and yeast) inoculated with 100 µl of each microorganism. Both the vaccinated and conventional tubes (without samples) were kept at their optimal growth temperatures for a period of twenty-four hours. The temperature for bacteria was 37 °C, while the temperature for yeast and fungi was 28 °C. Streptomycin was used as standard antibacterial (positive control), while Fluconazole served as standard anti-fungal. 10% (v/v) of (DMSO) act as a negative control. A spectrophotometer was utilized in order to determine the optical densities (O.D.) of the microbial growth at a wavelength of 625 nm. Experiments were carried out in duplicate for every strain of microorganisms that were put down for examination. These findings were reported in the form of an average value.\n$$Inhibition\\;of\\;microbial\\;growth(\\% ) = 100 - \\left[ {\\frac{O.D\\;of\\;sample(trail)}{{O.D\\;of\\;sample(s\\tan dard)}} \\times 100} \\right]$$\n (3) \nCytotoxicity assay\nThe Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay was used to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of the prepared samples against HSF: Human Skin Fibroblast. Nawah Scientific Inc., (Mokatam, Cairo, Egypt) provided the HSF. An amount of 10% (v/v) of (DMSO) was adapted as strong cytotoxic material (negative control), while, human skin fibroblast cells without addition of PVA:SA:TiO2 nanocomposite films (untreated cells) were used as blank control in the experiment. Aliquots of 100 μL cell suspension (5 × 103 cells) were in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h in complete media. Cells were treated with another aliquot of 100 μL media containing the prepared samples at various concentrations (50 and 100 μg/ml). After 72 h of samples' exposure, cells were fixed by adding 150 μL of 10% trichloroacetic (TCA) to the medium and incubating for one hour at 4 °C. After removing the TCA solution, the cells were washed five times with distilled water. Aliquots of 70 μL SRB solution (0.4% w/v) were added and incubated for 10 min in a dark place at room temperature40. The plates were air-dried overnight after being washed 3 times with 1% acetic acid. To dissolve the protein-bound SRB stain in the plates, 150 μL of 10 mM tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS) was added41. A BMG LABTECH- FLUO star Omega Microplate Reader (Ortenberg, Germany) was used to measure the absorbance at 540 nm.

The properties of the prepared nanofibers were controlled using different ratios of cerium. The results of XPS characterization revealed that the Ce element is present in the valence state + III on the surface of the TiO2 nanofibers. Rietveld refinement of XRD data reveals that introducing small concentrations of Ce3+ (<3.0 at%) into the electrospinning solution leads to the formation of small amounts of rutile and brookite phases, a decrease in the crystallite size of the main anatase phase and a slight decrease in the c parameter and unit cell volume of the anatase phase. In contrast, only the anatase phase, which has a similar crystallite size and lattice parameters to that formed in the undoped sample, is observed when 3 at.% Ce is used. These results suggest that Ce3+ ions did not substitute Ti4+ ions in the lattice of both anatase and rutile phases, which can be explained by the large difference in the ionic radius of Ti4+ and Ce3+ ((r (Ti4+) = 60.5 pm, r (Ce3+) = 101.7 pm). Scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that the diameter of the obtained nanofibers decreases from 240 nm for pristine TiO2 to 101 nm, 70 nm, 40 nm for 2% Ce/TiO2 (CET2), BN/TiO2 (BT) and BN/2% Ce/TiO2 (BCET2), respectively. The d-spacing decreased by 0.3 nm after Ce incorporation as demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. XPS proved the presence of BN nanosheets along with Ce2O3 and TiO2 into the nanofibers. Compared with the pure TiO2 nanofibers (NF), the obtained Ce/Ti ratio of 2% (molar ratio) showed an enhancement of the visible-light photocatalytic activity to water splitting, which is 46 times higher than that of bare TiO2 NF. The Ce2O3 might improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes derived from the coupling effect of TiO2 and cerium oxide. This work also examines the modification of TiO2 (anatase) properties with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and the impact this coupling has on photocatalytic activity. XPS proved the presence of BN nanosheets along with Ce2O3 and TiO2 into the nanofibers. The electron transfer rate was improved by BN exfoliation. The photocatalytic results indicated that the BN/Ce2O3/TiO2 nanofibers improve hydrogen production up to 5100 μmol/g for 6 h under visible light, which could be due to the presence of BN sheets that enhanced the separation of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs in TiO2 and increased the specific surface area compared to pure TiO2 and Ce2O3/TiO2 nanofibers. Moreover, the BN/Ce2O3/TiO2 could be easily recycled without decrease in the photocatalytic activity because of its one-dimensional nanostructure nature. Moreover, the present work focuses on the ternary composite of BN/Ce2O3/TiO2 for optimization of electronic and phonon transport properties using the state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT). The calculated electronic density of states (DOS) modulus shows an excellent agreement compared with available theoretical and experimental data for hydrogen production.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "BN/Ce2O3/TiO2", "application": "photocatalyst for hydrogen production via water splitting", "props": {"hydrogen production": "5100 μmol/g @ 6 h under visible light", "photocatalytic activity": "46 times higher than bare TiO2 NF"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "TiO2 nanofibers", "application": "photocatalyst for water splitting", "props": {}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Anions, specifically cyanide, occupy crucial roles in various biological, physiological, and industrial contexts. While cyanide is indispensable as a raw material in the synthesis of herbicides, resins, synthetic fibers, and the gold-extraction process, its widespread presence causes a significant threat to both environmental and social systems. Cyanide abundance in the environment arises not just from industrial effluents but also from the natural biological processes of fungi and algae. The dual nature of cyanide, serving both as a useful industrial component and a potential environmental hazard, highlights the importance of responsible management and regulation in its production and application. The detection of cyanide has become a matter of paramount importance due to its extreme toxicity and potential environmental contamination, where even micromolar levels can prove fatal to humans. In addressing this critical concern, researchers have focused on developing simple, inexpensive, and rapid detection methods, with chemosensors emerging as among the most promising solutions. These chemosensors rely on colorimetric and fluorometric responses, offering a synergistic combination that enhances the versatility of cyanide detection methodologies. Through novel design and synthesis, researchers have constructed a diverse range of chemosensors with tailored properties, such as high selectivity, low detection limits, and rapid response times. Especially, efforts have been directed towards making these detection systems portable and user-friendly, facilitating their practical implementation in real-world scenarios. This comprehensive review provides a focused examination of colorimetric and fluorescent probes designed for the specific and sensitive recognition of cyanide anions. Emphasizing their applicability in on-site portable strips and cellular imaging, the review aims to enhance readers' understanding of the critical need for monitoring cyanide ions in the context of human health and disease.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Preparation Methods and Composites’ Properties with TiO2 Nanoparticles\nThe unique properties of TiO2, especially nanoscale, are used to address important energy and environmental issues. This caused the recent big amount of scientific works on the synthesis and study of its antivirus properties and then the research for ways of its practical application [7]. The antiviral activity of TiO2 anatase nanoparticles against human adenovirus 5 serotypes was between 45 and 95%.\nThe production of crystalline titanium dioxide with maximum photocatalytic activity and stability in corrosive media (organic substances) is a priority for many researchers in the field of photocatalysis [8,9,10,11]. The author's many attempts have been made to dope titanium dioxide of the atom of sulphur, nitrogen, carbon, Ce, MnO2 to shift the absorption of the photocatalyst into the visible light and near-IR region [12,13,14,15,16]. For example, mixing the levels of p (nitrogen) with 2p (oxygen) makes it possible to narrow the width of the trapped zone of the oxide semiconductor. Doping with nitrogen has occurred when the powder is treated with nitrogen itself, ammonia or ammonium chloride and other nitrogen-containing compounds.\nDoping with metals is good because the Schottky barrier is created by contact of the metal with the surface of TiO2, which acts as an electron trap, as a consequence of which the recombination of electron hole pairs is suppressed during photocatalysis. The authors of refs [12, 13] note that when doping with metals (rare-earth) elements, it is possible to shift to the visible region, but the photocatalytic activity may decrease, especially in the UV range. For the electronic interaction, nitrogen is good because electrons can pass for the dopant of the orbitals 2p or 3p to the 3d orbital Ti, and the width of the forbidden band decreases. The problem of doped oxide TiO2 powders is that photocatalytic activity in a pollutant environment can sharply decrease, especially in the visible region.\nAn important role in the development of this area belongs to the conducting polymeric materials. It may be noted only a few basic functions that perform polymers TiO2 chemistry and other NPs [11, 16, 17]. There are several works devoted to research TiO2 in which an important part is given to polymers. But there are practically no studies on the kinetics of the synthesis of polymers in the presence of oxide NPs, particularly TiO2 [9, 17, 18].\nThe main task of nanocomposite materials manufacturing is to obtain the necessary level of controlled component dispersion and to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles [19,20,21,22]. This requirement can be designed to meet the chemical methods of forming composites, where one of the components synthesized previously obtained another component. For polyacrylate-NPs, systems mainly use two methods. Sol–gel synthesis is carried out from the TiO2 precursors with polyacrylate solution, dispersion or a polymer film. In both embodiments, to regulate and stabilize the dispersibility of the resulting composite suggest the formation of strong physical and chemical bonds between components. The choice of method is due to the requirement to obtain a final material.\nIn the processes for polyacrylate-TiO2 nanocomposites manufacturing as the binding agent phase chemical bonds were recently used in high-active alkoxysilanes. The siloxane component is obtained through ternary systems that perform several important functions.Alkoxysilane injection in small quantities is used to stabilize the nanoparticles and, in the result, better dispersed materials in an acrylate matrix [23,24,25] are received. The resulting polysiloxane on the surface of TiO2 particles protects the polymer matrix from the possible photocatalytic degradation.\nTo obtain stable clear homogeneous nanocomposite precursors or a mixture of inorganic nanoparticles, dispersion introduced monomer mixture with subsequent polymerization, in which the final stage is completed at room temperature [24]. This method is obtained composites for use in nonlinear optics. It is known that in optical quality PMMA material has a small refractive index in the visible range (n = 1.49). Whereas TiO2 is n = 2.45 (anatase form) and 2.70 (rutile). Using these data, Chen and co-workers obtained a hybrid composite using a sol–gel process and the MSMA to form interfacial chemical bonds. The resulting composite films were accompanied by a wide range of refractive index in the range of 1.202–1.867.\nThus, this area of the work allows to obtain polymeric materials with already combined unique properties, such as: optical (high transparency, high refractive index); catalytic (photochemical oxidation, photocatalysis), and some of the other valuable properties [26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42].\nThe presence of Ti3+ defects for the synthesized sample could be the reason for bandgap decrease in this semiconductor to 2.75 eV and growth of MO (methyl orange) anode oxidation currents under UV irradiation at high scan rates (above 50 mV/s) and potentials below 500 mV (SCE) comparing with standard samples [14]. The samples' photoelectrocatalytic activity is defined by the nanoparticles' nanodispersity form.\nThus, the scientific and technical information nanocomposites indicate great potential in the synthesis of nanocomposites, especially PANI and different porous structures, the most of the photoactive properties of oxide semiconductors NPs, PANI as well as receive photocatalytic systems based on them [39,40,41,42]. The nature of the porous structure of the photocatalyst, in turn, determines the structure and properties of interfacial layers, as well as the availability of exposure to the active surface of the catalyst and the substances, which are subject to degradation. The strong interaction between NP's oxide and polymer should be present for the efficient transmission of electronic processes. The reason is because it will strongly depend on the rate of hydroxyl radicals' generation, which determines the speed and completeness of decomposition reactions of toxic organic substances.\nPhotocatalytic degradation is an efficient and economical method that attracted increasing attention [26,27,28,29]. This is because it is particularly useful for cleaning biologically toxic or nondegradable materials such as aromatics, pesticides, petroleum constituents and volatile organic compounds in wastewater. The contaminant materials are converted to a large extent into stable inorganic compounds such as water, carbon dioxide and salts, i.e. they undergo mineralization.", "output": {}}

In a typical microwave treatment process, 100 mg LMO-p was mixed with distilled water (50 ml) and then subjected to microwave irradiation (using an in-house, custom-built laboratory microwave, 230 Volts, 10 Amps minimum, 50 Hertz, single phase dedicated circuit) at 600 W for 20 min. After which the mixture was dried in a vacuum oven to obtain the final product (LMO-m). As a control experiment, LMO-p was treated in distilled boiling water (pH ∼ 7.0) for 20 min, and worked-up as the microwave-treated sample. 2.2 Physico-chemical characterization Synchrotron XRD measurements were carried out at the XPD beamline of the LNLS synchrotron facility (Brazil). Measurements were conducted using a custom-built furnace operating in reflection mode geometry using beam energy of 7.5 keV and a Mythen 1K detector placed 1 m from the sample. The crystalline phase identification was done using DIFFRAC.EVA (Version 2. Release 2014) using the ICDD PDF2 database (Release 2016). Phase quantification was done using the Rietveld method as implemented in Bruker AXS TOPAS software (Version 5, 2014). The PND analysis was done at the NECSA SOC Limited, South Africa. The high-performance neutron diffraction instrument, PITSI was used to obtain data at room temperature. Wavelength 1.08 Å with incident beam size 5 mm x 35 mm (matched to sample contained in V-tube) Goniometer with 4 position-changer; sample rotated continuously; detector bank 17° coverage (4–10 hr per step) stepped in 6 steps to cover 2θ range 10 to 115°. Refinements were also done using GSAS II. Synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS) was performed with a hemispherical spectrometer from SPECS, model PHOIBOS150 HSA 3500 in operation at the CNPEM-LNLS (Brazil). The XPS has a monochromatic Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) source and a nine-channel electron multiplier detector. The monochromatic Al Kα source was operated at 10 kV and 10 mA. The spectra were obtained with an analyzer pass energy of 20 eV. The samples in powder form were supported on carbon double-sided tape and fixed on the XPS sample holder. The spectra were analyzed using the software Casa XPS, version 2.2.99. For comparison, XPS spectra of the LMO treated in boiling water and that of the LMO-p were run with a conventional XPS spectrometer (Ultra DLD XPS Kratos). XANES analysis was performed at the Mn K-edge (8333 eV) and Ni K-edge (6539 eV) at the DXAS beamline of the LNLS (Brazil). DXAS is a dispersive beamline equipped with a focusing curved Si (111) monochromator, operating in Bragg geometry. The monochromator was calibrated with Mn foils before each measurement. The 7Li MAS nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of the LMO samples were carried out using Bruker Avance-500 spectroscopy. The 514.5 nm line of an argon-ion laser and a Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer equipped with an Olympus BX41 microscope attachment was used to obtain the Raman spectra. The LabSpec v5 software was used to capture the data. The surface area of the samples was determined by the Micrometric Tristar 3000 BET. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were captured using a FEI Nova Nanolab 600 Instrument. 2.3 Electrochemical characterization The LMO cathode laminate was fabricated by mixing a slurry containing 70% LMO, 20% conductive additive and 10% PVDF in NMP. The prepared mix was pasted on an aluminum current collector and vacuum dried at 110 °C for 12 h. The dried laminate was then punched into a 12 mm disk for coin cell assembly and transferred into the glovebox. The cells were assembled in the glovebox using Li foil as the anode. LiPF6 (1 M) in EC/DEC/DMC (volume ratio 1:1:1) electrolyte and a micro-porous polypropylene Celgard H1612/16 μm separator were used.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Lithium metal is an ideal anode for high-energy-density rechargeable batteries. However, its practical applications are hindered by the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the dendrites’ growth and the fragile SEI. Both ionic solvation behavior and SEI formation strongly affect the stability of the Li metal anode in a rechargeable battery. In this paper, 1,3-dioxolane (DOL), the well-known weak solvating capability and good SEI formation, was used as the solvent in its-fluorinated ether (TTE) blends. DOL reduced the cation-solvents interaction but reinforced the cation-anions coordination, lowering the Li plating-stripping overpotential. The addition of TTE significantly reshaped the solvation structure of Li-ion in the mixed solvent of DOL-TTE in comparison to the concentration effect. Specifically, the high TTE contents improved the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte, generated more anion-derived SEI, and resulted in the uniform Li plating-stripping that correlated with the solvation structure of more ionic aggregates less free solvents and anions. Apart from stabilizing Li anode, the decreasing free solvents in DOL-TTE (1:2) electrolytes prevented the rapid capacity decline of Li-SPAN cells from the dissolution and loss of LiPSs, obtaining 92% capacity retention and 99.77% average CE after 100 cycles.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "DOL-TTE (1:2)", "application": "stabilizing lithium metal anode in Li-SPAN cells", "props": {"capacity retention": "92% after 100 cycles", "average Coulombic efficiency": "99.77% after 100 cycles"}}}}

Titanium oxysulfate (TiOSO4), glycerol (C3H8O3, 99%), zirconium chloride (ZrCl4, 98%), N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, 99.9%), 2-aminoteraphtalic acid (C8H7NO4, 99%), hydrochloric acid (37 wt%), diethyl ether (C4H10O, 99.7%), ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.5%), isopropanol (C3H8O, 99.7%), and methanol (CH3OH, 99.5%), were purchased from MACKLIN. 2.2 Material synthesis Synthesis of TiO 2 nanoplates assembled nanotubes: TiO2 nanoplates assembled nanotubes were produced via a hydrothermal synthesis, as reported in literature (Zhang et al., 2017). Typically, 1g titanium oxysulfate were dissolved in 18 mL ethanol under magnetic stirring and maintained for 30 min. Subsequently, 9 mL glycerol and 9 mL diethyl ether were added to the above solution under vigorously magnetic stirring and preserved at room temperature overnight. The white suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 170 °C for 10 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the white precipitate was filtered, washed with deionized water and ethanol for 5 times, and then dried at 60 °C for 3 h. Finally, TiO2 nanoplates assembled nanotubes were obtained via calcination of the white powder at 600 °C for 4 h. Synthesis of NH 2 -UiO-66: 0.54 mmol zirconium chloride, 5 mL DMF, and 1 mL hydrochloric acid were added to a 100 mL round bottom flask, and sonicated for 20 min to obtain a clear solution. 0.75 mmol 2-aminoteraphtalic acid and 10 mL DMF were then added to the solution which was subsequently sonicated for 20 min before heated at 80 °C overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the solid product was recovered and washed by centrifugation with methanol for 3 times, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Synthesis of popcorn-stick-like NH 2 -UiO-66/TiO 2 : An in-situ growth strategy was employed to synthesize NH2-UiO-66 on the as-made TiO2 nanoplates. 0.25 g as-synthesized TiO2 nanoplates, 0.54 mmol zirconium chloride, 5 mL DMF, and 1 mL hydrochloric acid were mixed together in a round bottom flask and sonicated for 20 min. Subsequently, 0.75 mmol 2-aminoteraphtalic acid and 10 mL DMF were added to the suspension, and sonicated for 30 min before heated at 80 °C for 12 h. After synthesis, the product was obtained and washed by centrifugation with methanol for 3 times, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The hydrothermal temperature, the presence and the amounts of hydrochloric acid are significantly important for the synthesis of popcorn-stick-like NH2-UiO-66/TiO2. Sample preparation for photocatalytic experiments: Typically, 5 mg of Printex U was suspended in isopropanol and then dispersed onto the bottom of a quartz lining, creating a carbon black layer. 50 mg of photocatalysts were subsequently deposited onto the carbon particle layer by drop-casting and evaporating an isopropanol suspension. The materials coated quartz lining was dried at 120 °C overnight. 2.3 Material characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed in Bruker D8 Advance. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the samples were taken on Hitachi S-4800. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were conducted using Bruker XFlash 6160. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTRM) were recorded on JEOLJEM-2100 to analyze ultramicroscopic morphology and crystal structure of materials. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of different materials were obtained by a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out in ESCALABXi+. 2.4 Photocatalytic carbon oxidation with NO2 Photocatalytic experiments were conducted in a quartz lining containing photo-reactor (CEAuLight). Typically, the as prepared sample was placed inside the reactor and illuminated from the top with a 500 W Xe lamp (CEAuLight) without cut-off filter at a light intensity of 254.7 mW/cm2. A quartz plate (diameter: 8 mm) and O-ring were used for sealing of the photo-reactor. NO2 (2% in He), and N2 are fed to the reactor from gas cylinders via mass flow controllers (Sevenstar). Water was removed from the gas stream after reaction for the analyzer protection using a gas cooler with the dew point of 3 °C. The products are detected by a UV detector (Cubic-Ruiyi Gasboard 3000UV) for NO and NO2 and a NDIR detector (Cubic-Ruiyi Gasboard 3000PLUS) for CO and CO2. CO2 was removed from the stream by a soda lime filter before N2O was monitored by Geotech G200 analyzer avoiding the influence of CO2 on N2O detection.

The amorphous TiO₂ (TiO₂@DES) exhibited significantly higher surface area and pore volume compared to commercial TiO₂, while the calcined TiO₂ (TiO₂@DES_400) displayed enhanced crystallinity with an anatase structure. The TiO₂@C composite was prepared via an in-situ decoration of biomass-derived carbon during the TiO₂ electrochemical synthesis. This resulted in a material with a high specific surface area (2214 m2 g−1) and porous structure. This composite demonstrated superior photocatalytic performance for the degradation of crystal violet dye under both UV and visible light irradiation, achieving degradation efficiencies of ~98 % after 5 h. The TiO₂@C composite was further applied to degrade wastewater from leather dye processing, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world applications. These results underscore the potential of the TiO₂@C composite as a sustainable and high-performance photocatalyst for environmental remediation, particularly in wastewater treatment.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "TiO₂@C composite", "application": "photocatalyst for wastewater treatment", "props": {"specific_surface_area": "2214 m²/g", "degradation_efficiency": "~98% @ 5 h (UV/visible light)"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "TiO₂@DES (amorphous)", "application": "photocatalyst", "props": {}}, "MAT3": {"name": "TiO₂@DES_400 (calcined)", "application": "photocatalyst", "props": {}}, "MAT4": {"name": "TiO₂_NP (commercial TiO₂ nano-powder)", "application": "photocatalyst", "props": {}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experiments 2.1 Materials Titanium (IV) n-butoxide (TBOT, 99%) was purchased from ACROS. Poly(ethersulfone) (PES, 5900P) was purchased from Sumitomo chemical advanced technologies. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, K-30, M w = 40 kDa) was purchased from ISP technology. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc, 99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. HCl(aq) (37%) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, 66 kDa, 98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) standards (M w: 42.7, 98, 289, 537, and 1000 kDa) were purchased from PSS Polymer. All materials were used as received. 2.2 Synthesis of the TiO2 sol TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a version of the sol–gel method [26]. Briefly, TBOT was mixed with DMAc to form a homogeneous solution. Then, HCl(aq) (28.2 wt%) with additional DMAc were added drop-by-drop into the solution to initiate the hydrolysis-condensation of TBOT. The molar ratio of TBOT/H2O/DMAc was set to 1/2.28/4.61. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 25 °C under agitation. The formed product (termed T-sol) consists of TiO2, H2O, DMAc, and 1-butanol, and their molar ratios are 1/0.28/4.61/4. The by-product 1-butanol was removed by vacuum distillation of the sol at 60 °C to minimize its effect on membrane formation. The amount of condensed distillate was weighted and its composition was determined through refractometry. The refractive index of the condensed distillate was measured and compared with the calibration line given in Fig. S2 of the supporting information. The molar ratios of TiO2, DMAc, and 1-butanol in the vacuum-distilled sol (termed rT-sol) are 1/3.27/0.46. It is worth noting that ∼88.5% of the 1-butanol has been removed and the remaining 1-butanol comprises ∼8.5 wt% of the sol. As water exists only in trace amount, its content is ignored in subsequent casting dope preparation. FTIR and DLS analyses of the sols are described in the supporting information (cf. Fig. S3 and Fig. S4). The particle size of the rT-sol falls over a narrow range of 1.5–4 nm, which is typical of a sol–gel process carried out under a strong acidic condition. 2.3 Membrane preparation PES membranes in the form of flat sheets were prepared by the nonsolvent induced phase separation process. Briefly, an appropriate amount of PES was mixed with DMAc and PVP in a glass bottle sealed with a Teflon-lined cap. The mixture was blended at 60 °C on a roller mixer until a homogeneous solution was obtained. It was cooled to 25 °C and then rT-sol was added under agitation to give a clear dope that contains finely dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles. The compositions of the dopes are summarized in Table 1 . The dope was allowed to stand at 25 °C for 0.5 h to remove bubbles arising from agitation. Subsequently, the dope was spread on a glass plate by means of a casting bar with a clearance of 200 μm. Following casting, the solution was air-exposed (70% RH and 30 °C) for 40 s. and then immersed in a water bath to precipitate the polymer. The formed nascent membrane was rinsed repeatedly with water to ensure complete removal of DMAc and most PVP (the residual amount of PVP was determined by NMR analysis). The cleaned membrane was dried for morphology imaging, tensile testing, NMR analysis, etc. The drying procedure involves lightly-pressing the membrane between sheets of filter papers, drying under ambient condition (25 °C, 70% RH) for 2 days, and then at 60 °C for 1 day in a vacuum oven. 2.4 Characterization of the membranes Full details of characterization are available in the supporting information. Infrared spectra of the sols were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR, Nicolet iS10, Thermo Fisher) in the transmission mode. The size of TiO2 (dispersed in the sol) was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Nano ZS, Malvern) at 25 °C. Morphologies of the membranes were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). Contact angles of water on the membrane surfaces were measured using a contact angle/surface energy analyzer (FTA125, First Ten Ångstroms) at 25 °C. The tensile strengths at break for various membranes were measured using a universal testing apparatus (Autograph AGS-J, Shimadzu). The glass transition temperatures (T g) of the membranes were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Q20, TA Instrument). Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, Avance II 600, Bruker) spectroscopy was employed to determine the amount of PVP left in the formed PES membrane. The porosities of the membranes were estimated on the basis of the thickness and weight of the membrane sample. Pure water fluxes and solute rejections of the membranes were measured by the use of a dead-end type of filtration cell. BSA with an average molecular weight of 66 kDa was employed as the solute. The concentration of the solute in the feed (Cb ) and the filtrate (Cf ) were used to calculate the rejection coefficient (R) based on the following equation: (1) R = ( 1 − C f C b ) × 100 % To evaluate its antifouling capability, the above membrane was cleaned and its water flux Jw′ was measured again. This procedure was repeated twice. The flux recovery ratio (FRR) was calculated by: (2) FRR ( % ) = J w ′ J w × 100 % where Jw is the water flux of a virgin membrane. Also, the intrinsic resistance (Rm ), fouling resistance (Rf ), and total resistance (Rt ) of the membranes were determined based on the following equations [21,23]: (3) R m = Δ P μ × J w (4) R t = Δ P μ × J w ′ (5) R f = R t − R m where μ is the viscosity of the feed solution. For measuring Jw and Jw' (water fluxes) the value of μ = 8.9×10−4 Pa·s. The molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membranes was determined by filtration of a series of PEG standards of different molecular weights. Water was used as the solvent and the concentration of the feed was maintained at 0.1 wt% for all experiments. MWCO was defined as the molecular weight at which 90% rejection occurs.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "TiO2 sol", "Syns_method": "sol–gel method", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "TBOT", "amount": "1 mol"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMAc", "amount": "4.61 mol"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "react", "parameters": {"temperature": "25 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "vacuum distillation", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C"}}}}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Polyacrylonitrile (PAN, Mw=150,000) was purchased from Tianjin Siense Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, high flow injection grade), and iron acetylacetonate (Fe(C5H7O2)3, 98%) were obtained from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. N,N‑dimethylformamide (DMF, AR) was purchased from Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemical Company. All materials were used as received, without further purification. The electrolyte was purchased from Dodochem Co., Ltd. The lithium foils were obtained from Tianjin Zhongneng Lithium Industry Co., Ltd. The electrolyte and lithium foils were stored and handled in a glove box under Ar atmosphere (<0.1 ppm H2O and <0.1 ppm O2). 2.2 Preparation of PCNF-Fe Firstly, 0.4 g and 0.6 g of Fe(C5H7O2)3 were weighed and dissolved in 4.4 g of DMF, respectively. Subsequently, 0.6 g of PAN and 0.04 g of PMMA were added, and the resulting solution was stirred magnetically at 50 °C in a water bath for 12 h to form a homogeneous precursor solution. The precursor solution was drawn into a 10 mL syringe equipped with a stainless steel needle (19 G). A positive voltage of 10 kV is applied to the roller from a positive high-voltage DC power supply, and a negative voltage of 8 kV is applied to the needle from a negative high-voltage DC power supply. The distance between the needle and the roller was 12 cm, the feed rate was 0.5 mL/h, and the rotation speed of the roller was 900 r/min. The temperature and humidity of the environment were maintained at 20 °C and 25%, respectively. The prepared fiber membrane was placed in a vacuum drying oven and dried at 50 °C for 12 h to remove a large amount of solvent. The newly obtained fiber membrane was cut, and the obtained fiber membrane sheets were placed in a vacuum tube furnace with a heating procedure from room temperature to 250 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min for 2 h in air. Then, the temperature was raised to 800 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained for 1 h. The cooling was carried out at a rate of 5 °C/min under nitrogen protection to 300 °C, followed by cooling of the furnace to room temperature. Pure carbon nanofiber (CNF) was also prepared according to the same method as a control group. 2.3 Material characterizations Morphology and structure were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4700). Crystallinity was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Ultima IV), and X-ray diffraction spectra were recorded in the 2θ range of 5–90° The graphite properties and microstructure of carbon materials were examined by confocal micro-Raman spectrometer (Raman, inVia Reflex), and the test excitation wavelength selected for the material was 514 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Nicolet 6700) was used to analyze the functional groups of the samples. Among them, thin film or block samples are analyzed by attenuated total reflection technique, and powder samples are analyzed by potassium bromide compression method. The surface electronic structure and composition were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Escalab 250). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a simultaneous thermal analyzer (TGA/DSC3+), and the sample was heated from room temperature to 800 °C in an air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The CR2032 coin cells were assembled in a glove box filled with argon to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the 3D PCNF-Fe host. For symmetric cells testing, self-supported Li@PCNF-Fe or Li@CNF with an area of 0.5024 cm2 was used as the working electrode, and the lithium foil was used as the counter electrode. To test the performance of the symmetric cells, lithium metal with a capacity of 4 mAh cm−2 was preplated into the working electrode at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 to obtain Li@PCNF-Fe or Li@CNF with a lithium loading of 4 mAh cm−2. The electrolyte was 1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (LiTFSI) and 0.2 M LiNO3 in dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3‑dioxolane (DOL) at a volume ratio of 1:1. The separator used was a polypropylene/polyethylene microporous membrane (Celgard 2325). The cycling performance was tested at current densities of 1, 2 and 3 mA cm−2. For the test of coulombic efficiency, PCNF-Fe or CNF was chosen as the working electrode, and the lithium foil was still used as the counter electrode with a cut-off voltage of 1 V during lithium stripping. 2.5 Calculation method All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the CASTEP code in the Materials Studio package. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was adopted for the DFT calculations. The energy cutoff was set to 435.4 eV. To obtain the simulated model, a single layer of 5 × 5 × 1 graphene supercell was used, in which the CC bond was broken to form four unsaturated C atoms. The unsaturated C atoms were replaced with N atoms, while forming coordination with Fe atom at the same time. Furthermore, N-doped graphene was constructed into the 5 × 5 × 1 supercell for comparison. Geometry optimization was stopped when the forces on all atoms were less than 0.05 eV/Å. Each model was allowed to interact with lithium atom and the binding energy Eb was defined as: Eb=Etotal-Eslab-ELi, where Etotal, Eslab, and ELi were the total energy of the model bound with lithium atom, the total energy of the original model, and the total energy of single lithium atom, respectively.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "PCNF-Fe", "Syns_method": "electrospinning", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Fe(C5H7O2)3", "amount": "1.0 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "PAN", "amount": "0.6 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "PMMA", "amount": "0.04 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMF", "amount": "4.4 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "50 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "250 °C", "time": "2 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "800 °C", "time": "1 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "CNF", "Syns_method": "electrospinning", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "PAN", "amount": "0.6 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "PMMA", "amount": "0.04 g"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "DMF", "amount": "4.4 g"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "50 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "250 °C", "time": "2 h"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "800 °C", "time": "1 h"}}}}}}}

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Cobalt acetate tetrahydrate, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, ≥97% pure), isopropanol and Triton X-100 from Sigma Aldrich has been utilized. Hydrochloric acid, ethanol and sodium hydroxide has been obtained from Merck. For filtration, 0.22 µm sized, cellulose nitrate ﬁlter membranes (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Germany) were used. The CNTs were obtained from China. No further purification procedure was followed. 2.2 Material preparation Acid functionalization of CNTs has been carried out as mentioned in detail in our previous work [27]. Afterwards these functionalized CNTs have been composited with CoxTi1−xO2 (x = 0.03, 0.05, 0.07). For the synthesis of TiO2, TTIP (6 mL) has been added to 80 mL of isopropanol with stirring. A 1% Triton X-100 and a few drops of HCl (1 M) were added to adjust the pH of about 1. After 15 min of stirring TiO2 has been precipitated using NaOH and the TiO2 hydrogel is then kept stirring for an hour, filtered, washed with dilute HCl and later with deionized water to a neutral pH. Subsequent drying at 100 °C in the oven and calcinations at 400 °C for 4 h has been carried to get the anatase TiO2 nanocrystals. In the case of TiO2/CNTs same procedure has been adopted whereby 5 wt% carboxyl functionalized CNTs were also added while for CoxTi1−xO2/CNTs samples, cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (3, 5 and 7 wt%) has been added along with 5 wt% carboxyl functionalized CNTs, proceeded by precipitation using NaOH. The precipitates were filtered, washed, dried and finally calcined to get a dull greyish green product. 2.3 Physical characterizations XRD studies have been carried out using (XRD, Bruker-D8) equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). A Mettler Toledo thermal analyzer was used for thermal analysis. Ex-situ diffraction studies were arranged using (R–AXIS IV++, Rigaku) whereby, the cells were disassembled in an argon environment in a glove box and the cycled active materials were separately filled in glass capillaries after removing Cu foil. The sealed capillaries were used for ex-situ XRD using Mo-Kα source (λ = 0.7107 Å) source and GSAS-II was employed for getting Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) XRD patterns [28]. Near edge X-ray absorption fine structures (NEXAFS) taking the L-edge for Ti and Co while for O and C K-edge were measured at 10D KIST-PAL beamline at Pohang Light Source (PLS-II). All the spectra were collected in a total electron yield (TEY) mode at room temperature, with a resolution of 0.01 eV, and a high vacuum of 4 × 10−10 Torr. Transmission electron microscope (TEM), JEM 2100 plus, has been utilized for studying morphology and dimension of the nanocomposite while the sample preparation was carried out by dispersion of 10 mg of sample in ethanol followed by ultrasonication and placing a drop of supernatant suspension onto a copper grid. The surface analysis has been made using XPS (Scienta-Omicron) using a micro-focused monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. C 1 s peak (284.8 eV) was taken as a reference for calibrating the binding energies. 2.4 Electrode preparation and electrochemical testing Fabrication of coin cells CR2032 had been proceeded for galvanostatic charge-discharge studies in Argon filled glove box (H2O and O2<0.1 ppm). The working electrodes (anode) were prepared using active material/super P/polyvinyllidene fluoride (PVDF) dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone in a ratio of 7:2:1. The slurry was casted onto the Cu foil keeping uniform mass loading of 3.0 mg cm–2 with a thickness of ~35 µm.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and methods details 2.1 Materials preparation After the vacuum melting and rolling process, the as-rolled Mg-4Li, Mg-4Li-3Al, Mg-4Li-3Al-1Si, Mg-4Li-3Al-1Si-0.5Y alloys (in wt%, denoted as L4, LA43, LAS431, LASW4310 respectively) were prepared. In Fig. 1, the different surfaces of the rolled sheet are defined as the rolling direction (RD) plane, the normal direction (ND) plane and the transverse direction (TD) plane. As displayed in Table 1, in virtue of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES; Varian 715-ES), the actual chemical constituents were precisely detected. 2.2 Microstructure characterization The specimens were burnished with abrasive paper from 1000 to 5000 grit, followed by polishing with 0.5 µm diamond abrasive paste, and finally etched with 4% nitric acid alcohol for 10–20 s. Subsequently, the microstructures of the alloy were characterized by Optical Microscope (OM; Olympus SX-53, Japan) and scanning electron microscope (SEM; Zeiss Ultra 55, Germany) fitted with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Phase compositions were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD; X Pert pro Netherlands). Additionally, the scanning angle range was set from 5° to 90° and the scanning speed was 6°/min. 2.3 Electrochemical corrosion measurements Electrochemical testing was carried out using the electrochemical workstation (CS Studio5, CorrTest, China), equipped with a saturated glycolic electrode and a platinum electrode. Correspondingly, the test specimens, sampled on the “ND” side, were defined as the working electrode. After using an epoxy inlay to ensure an exposed area of 1 cm2. Specimens were sanded smooth on 5000 grit abrasive paper before testing. The 3.5 wt% NaCl solution was chosen as electrolyte, test temperature was ensured to be 25 °C by heating in a water bath. The working electrode was immersed in the electrolyte for 15 min prior to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. The relatively stable open circuit potential reflected that the test system had reached a steady state. The scanning frequency of EIS was set from 10−2 to 105 Hz together with 5 mV perturbation amplitude. EIS spectra were detected by virtue of ZSimpWin software. Initial and termination potentials for the dynamic potential polarization curves were −2 and −1.2 V, and the scanning rate was 0.25 mV/s. Furthermore, the corrosion current density and corrosion potential were computed with the aid of Tafel fitting. Each test was conducted for five times to guarantee the accuracy of data. 2.4 Immersion experiment The immersion test was a simple and effective method for measuring the hydrogen evolution and weight loss tests, which provided an accurate indication of the corrosion resistance. Hydrogen collection depended on the drainage method, the corresponding apparatus is shown in Fig. 2. Samples, with the size of 10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm, were submerged in the 3.5 wt% NaCl solution at 25 °C. By calculating the measured data, the instantaneous and average corrosion rates of the samples were obtained [17,18]. According to the ASTM G31–72 standard [19], the average corrosion rate was investigated by combining the weight loss with the collected hydrogen rate. The total weight loss was converted from the amount of hydrogen collected (0.001083 g consumed Mg =1 mL H2), and represented by the following equation: (1) CR = − 8.76 × 10 4 × ∆ g A × t × ρ where Δg is the weight loss (g), which is obtained via immersion test. A denotes the surface area of the exposed specimen (cm2), and the total immersion time (h) is expressed in terms of t. The density of the alloy (g/cm3) is determined by using the drainage method and defined with ρ. The samples were soaked in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution for 24 h. Initially, the corrosion products of the alloy were observed separately by SEM. Then, the oxide layer was calculated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ESCALAB250, USA). After removing the oxide layer with chromic acid (100 g CrO3 + 5 g AgNO3 + 500 mL deionized water), the mass loss measurements were conducted. After removing the corrosion products, the corrosion patterns of samples were photographed by SEM. In addition, the physical shapes on the specimen surface were probed with 3D laser confocal microscopy (Olympus OLS4100, Japan) [20]. 2.5 Battery test The constant-current discharge tests of the batteries with four alloys as anodes were performed by a battery test system (LANDHE; CT3001A, China), as shown in Fig. 3. To systematically evaluate the discharge performance of the alloys in the low power battery system, we chose current densities of 5, 10, 20, and 40 mA.cm−2 and discharge durations of 5 h. The electrolytic cells were all self-designed and used the same specifications. A commercial gas diffusion electrode with a MnO2/C catalyst served as the air cathode. The electrolyte is 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, and the reaction areas of the anode and cathode were 1 and 9 cm2, respectively. The anodic efficiency of the anodes was computed using the weight loss method after ensuring the removal of surface discharge products by chromic acid.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Mg-4Li", "Syns_method": "vacuum melting and rolling", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Mg", "amount": "96 wt%"}, "prc2": {"name": "Li", "amount": "4 wt%"}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Mg-4Li-3Al", "Syns_method": "vacuum melting and rolling", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Mg", "amount": "93 wt%"}, "prc2": {"name": "Li", "amount": "4 wt%"}, "prc3": {"name": "Al", "amount": "3 wt%"}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "Mg-4Li-3Al-1Si", "Syns_method": "vacuum melting and rolling", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Mg", "amount": "92 wt%"}, "prc2": {"name": "Li", "amount": "4 wt%"}, "prc3": {"name": "Al", "amount": "3 wt%"}, "prc4": {"name": "Si", "amount": "1 wt%"}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "Mg-4Li-3Al-1Si-0.5Y", "Syns_method": "vacuum melting and rolling", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Mg", "amount": "91.5 wt%"}, "prc2": {"name": "Li", "amount": "4 wt%"}, "prc3": {"name": "Al", "amount": "3 wt%"}, "prc4": {"name": "Si", "amount": "1 wt%"}, "prc5": {"name": "Y", "amount": "0.5 wt%"}}}}}}

The synthesis process involved grinding the initial oxides in various ratios, followed by calcination at 1350 °C for 6 h under an argon flow in vacuum tube furnaces. Subsequently, the resulting powders were finely ground and subjected to another round of calcination following the same procedure for further purification, as confirmed by XRD analysis of the obtained SBN powder purity levels (as shown in Fig. S1). Stoichiometric amounts of nanosized Ti powders were then mixed with the purified Sr0.6La0.4Nb2O6-δ calcined powders. Next, the thoroughly mixed powder will be subjected to spark plasma sintering (SPS) in a vacuum environment. The temperature will increase at a rate of 50 °C/min until it reaches 1573 K, and then be maintained at a constant temperature and pressure of 45 MPa for 5 min. The ceramic samples were ultimately obtained. The purity analysis of the Sr0.6La0.4Nb2O6-δ/x wt% Ti (x = 1, 3, 5, and 10) samples was performed using a Bruker AXS X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu-K radiation for data collection of Powder X-ray diffraction patterns. Data acquisition was conducted with Bruker software at a step size of 0.04° in 2θ. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using Shimadzu Ltd.'s AXIS Supra XPS instrument equipped with a monochromatic Al Ka radiation source. Microscopic morphology and composition analysis were performed using a JSM-6700 F scanning electron microscope along with its accessory, the X-ray energy dispersive spectroscope. The Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of a standard sample, with dimensions measuring 12 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm, were simultaneously measured via a thermoelectric test system (CTA-3S, Cryoall, China) using a four-probe method in a low-pressure helium atmosphere from 323 to 1073 K. Measurements of carrier concentration and mobility were conducted using an HMS-3000 Hall effect test system. Thermal conductivity testing was conducted on small squares (6 × 6 × 1 mm) cut from the disk samples. The thermal conductivity was determined by employing the equation κ = λC p ρ, where C p , λ, and ρ represent the specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity, and mass density respectively. The C p and λ values were determined in the temperature range of 323–1073 K using Linseis Laser Flash Analyzer 500. The electronic and thermal transport parameters were measured using the commercially available CTA-3S (Cryoall, China) and LFA-500 (Linseis, Germany) instruments, respectively. The measured results exhibited minimal dependence on sample size, with errors primarily attributed to the standard deviations of these instruments. Specifically, the systematic errors in Seebeck coefficient (S) and electrical conductivity (σ) measurements were approximately 3 % and 5 %, respectively. The combined uncertainty for the total thermal conductivity κ tot was approximately 7 %, derived from d κ t o t κ t o t = ( d ρ ρ ) 2 + ( d C p C p ) 2 + ( d D D ) 2 (with an uncertainty of 1 % for the density ρ, 5 % for the specific heat C p , and 5 % for the thermal diffusion D). The uncertainty of the ZT value was ultimately estimated to be approximately 10 %. The computational formula employed for this estimation was d ( Z T ) Z T = ( 2 × dS S ) 2 + ( d σ σ ) 2 + ( d κ t o t κ t o t ) 2 .", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Sr0.6La0.4Nb2O6-δ/x wt% Ti", "Syns_method": "solid-state reaction", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Ti powder", "amount": "x wt%"}}, "solvents": {}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "spark plasma sintering", "parameters": {"temperature": "1573 K", "time": "5 min", "pressure": "45 MPa", "ramp_rate": "50 °C/min"}}}}}}}

By employing UiO-66 and NH2-UiO-66 solid acid catalysts, n-amyl acetate can be produced without the corrosive impact and separation problems associated with homogeneous catalysis by mineral acids. Thermal, structural, textural, and morphological properties of the catalysts were evaluated by TG-DTA, XRD, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, BET-surface area, SEM and HRTEM.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental\nMaterials and chemicals\nAll chemicals were used as received without any further purification. Deionized (DI) water is used throughout the study. Cobalt–nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, AR), thioacetamide (TAA, AR), and sublimed sulfur (99.5%, AR) were purchased from Aladdin in Shanghai.\nPreparation of carboxy modified CNT and ZIF-67 precursors\nFirst, a certain amount of CNT was weighed and added 30 ml of HNO3 solution (16 mol/l) for ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. The above solution was then placed in a water bath for 2–4 h with vigorous stirring (the purpose is to make the nitric acid molecules fully contact with CNT). After standing for 3 h, add deionized water and perform suction filtration with a vacuum suction filter. Repeat the steps 6–7 times and wash the solution to neutral PH value; finally, carboxyl-modified CNT was obtained. The ZIF-67 precursor was prepared according to the previous literature. The steps are as follows: weigh an adequate amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol) dissolved in methanol (50 ml) to form solution A and weigh 2-Melm (4 mmol) dissolved in methanol (20 ml) to form a solution B. The solution B was gradually added to solution A with vigorous stirring for 10 min, and the resulting mixed solution was aged for 12 h at room temperature. Finally, ZIF-67 monomer was obtained by multiple centrifugation with methanol.\nPreparation of CNT-CoSO4-n (n = 1, 2, 3) composite\nBriefly, 0.1 g treated CNT was dissolved into 20 ml of deionized water and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min to form suspension A. Secondly, 10 mmol of TAA was added to a solution containing 10 mmol of ZIF-67 to form solution B; solution B was quickly added to solution A to form solution C. Finally, solution C was reacted in a water bath at 60 °C. The obtained sample was labeled as CNT-CoSO4-2, and other samples were prepared by the same method with labeled as CNT-CoSO4-1 (0.5 mmol ZIF-67 and 5 mmol TAA) and CNT-CoSO4-3 (1.5 mmol ZIF-67 and 15 mmol TAA), respectively.\nPreparation of CNT/S and CNT-CoSO4-n/S (n = 1, 2, 3) composite and cell\nThe CNT/S and CNT-CoSO4-n/S (n = 1, 2, 3) composites were synthesized by the classical melt diffusion method. Prepared CNT and CNT-CoSO4-n/S (n = 1, 2, 3) were mixed with sublimated sulfur (99.5%, AR) in a mass ratio of 3:7 and milled for 30 min to make the mixture homogeneous. Ultimately, CNT/S and CNT-CoSO4-n/S composites were obtained at 155 °C for 20 h.\nCNT/S and CNT-CoSO4-n/S (n = 1, 2, 3) composites, super P, and oil binder (PVDF) were mixed in the mass ratio of 7:2:1 with appropriate amount of n-methyl-2-pyridone (NMP) to adjust the viscosity and ultrasonic treatment for 6 h. The mixed slurry was evenly deposited on the aluminum foil, vacuum dried at 60 °C for 12 h, and the cathode material was sliced into discs with a diameter of 12 mm.\nMaterial characterization\nThe crystal structure of the sample is tested by Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer, which uses Cu Kα-ray radiation at 40 kV, and the range of 2θ is 10–80°. At an operating voltage of 20 kV, the morphology and structure of the cathode materials were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy. The internal structure and elemental distribution of the cathode material at an operating voltage of 200 kV were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-210F devices). The composition and chemical state of the elements in the material were analyzed by multifunctional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using Mg Kα radiation source. The sulfur content in the material was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).\nElectrochemical characterization\nTo test the electrochemical performance of CNT/S and CNT-CoSO4-n/S composites, a CR2025 button cell was assembled, in which a separation diaphragm was adopted with a polypropylene microporous membrane (Cellgard2500). Lithium metal was used as the anode, and the electrolyte used was 1 mol/l lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiTFSI), 1,3-dioxane DOL, and DME (1:1 by volume) with 2.0% LiNO3 added, and the electrolyte was added to about 30 μl.\nThe whole assembly process must be carried out in a high purity Ar2 glove box with water and oxygen content below 0.5 ppm. The LAND CT3001A battery test system (LAND CT3001A, Jinnuo Electronics Co., Wuhan, China) was used to test the coin battery charge and discharge performance. At indoor temperature, the spectra of both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were obtained by electrochemical workstation (CS350H, Wuhan, China).

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Materials and Methods\nA commercially available polyvinylsilazane (Durazane®1800, Merk Chemicals) precursor was doped by Ti using tetrabutyl orthotitanate (Ti(OC4H9)4, Alfa Aesar, USA) as a metal precursor. The molecular structure of polyvinylsilazane (PVS) used comprises 20% methyl/vinyl and 80% of methyl/hydride silazane based monomers (Fig. 1). Tetrabutyl orthotitanate was dissolved in ethanol and instantly mixed with the PVS solution in a ratio of Ti:Si as 0.2 by mol%. Also, 1wt% of dicumyl peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich®, India) was added for easy crosslinking of the mixed solution. The crosslinking reaction was carried out at 300 °C for 2 h in a controlled box furnace having a vertical glass column attached with the flowing N2 source. The key crosslinking reaction involves combination of Ti with Si via O bond, hydrosilylation between vinyl and Si–H groups and polymerization of the vinyl groups [42, 43]. The crosslinking process resulted a thermoset (pale yellow solid mass), which was milled in fines (Fig. 2a) using a High-energy mechanical milling (SPEX 8000 M SamplePrep, USA) by means of zirconia pot and ball.\nFig. 1\nMolecular structure of Durazane®1800 precursor\nFull size image\nFig. 2\na High energy milled PVS-Ti(b)-300 powder b PVS-Ti(b)-900 powder c PVS-Ti(b)-1400 powder\nFull size image\nThe resultant powder (termed PVS-Ti(b)-300) was heat treated in a tube furnace at high temperatures ranging 900 °C to 1400 °C for 2 h, with a uniform heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and nitrogen flow rate of 80 ml min−1. The resultant samples were dark colored powders, termed as PVS-Ti(b)-900 to PVS-Ti(b)-1400 for pyrolysis temperatures of 900 °C (cf. Figure 2b) and 1400 °C (cf. Figure 2c), respectively.\nPolymer to ceramic transformation and mass loss of crosslinked PVS-Ti(b)-300 sample during ceramization was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (Netzsch, Germany, STA/TG-DSC) under flowing nitrogen. The calorimetric aspects of the crosslinked sample during ceramic conversion reactions, phase formation and crystallization phenomena were also studied by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) attached with TG analyzer. The dissolution of Ti into ceramic matrix of pyrolyzed Ti doped PVS sample were confirmed through energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) data obtained through scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI, Nova NanoSEM, Eindhoven, NL) by applying 15 kV accelerating voltage to the emission electron gun. Further, all the ceramic samples were scanned in the 1000 cm−1 to 2000 cm−1 spectral range through PL micro Raman spectrometer (XMB3000, WITec GmbH, Germany) having an Ar laser wavelength of 532 nm. The acquired Raman spectra were analyzed to understand the structural evolution of the free carbon (Cfree) phase within the ceramic matrix at different pyrolysis temperatures. Also, the pyrolyzed samples were evaluated by an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV, Japan) using Cu-Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 10° to 80° at a scan rate of 20° min−1 to understand the phase evolution in the ceramic. The evolved nanostructure within the SiTiCNO ceramic matrix was observed by bright field and high resolution imaging using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 80-300) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The sample for TEM observation were prepared by dropcasting a uniformly dispersed solution of the ceramic powders in isopropanol on a carbon coated copper grid (300 mesh, Ted Pella, USA).

In this paper, a heterojunction structure was formed by using the force assembly between two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (2D g-C3N4） and one-dimensional titanium dioxide nanorods (1D TNr）, and then the surface was modified by 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTS). MGT (Modified g-C3N4/TNr Heterojunction Composite) heterojunction was uniformly dispersed in the PVDF/PTFE mixture to form a coating that can be easily applied for spraying. MGT has superior charge carrier separation and high visible light absorption, which endows the MGT/PVDF/PTFE coating with exceptional performance in visible photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. The micro-nano 3D structure with low surface energy constructed by MGT and PVDF/PTFE contributes to the superhydrophobicity of the coating. The outstanding visible light photocatalytic and superhydrophobicity provide the coating with highly efficient self-cleaning performance. Impressively, the coating presents remarkable abrasion resistance and resistance to harsh environments such as acids, alkalis, salts, and UV irradiation thanks to the firm adhesion of MGT, the excellent solvent, and oxidation resistance of PVDF/PTFE.

Then, β-ketoamine-linked KE-COF-y were obtained by the reconstruction of EN-COF-x in alkaline solution. The photocatalytic performance of COFs before and after the isomerization from enols to ketones were investigated. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations clearly demonstrated that the carbonyl groups not only make the conduction band energy level more negative, but also lead to a more inhomogeneous charge distribution in the molecule, which improved the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons. In addition, the increase in the number of hydroxyl groups on triformylbenzene monomer contributed to the formation of more carbonyl groups in the COF frameworks, which is beneficial to improving its photocatalytic performance. KE-COF-3 synthesized from 2,4,6-Trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde has more carbonyl group units and more suitable redox potential, which effectively promoted the debromination reaction with 99% yield under light irradiation.

The application of photocatalysis as a pretreatment to improve effluent quality and treatment performance has shown effective results in the treatment of textile wastewater by nanofiltration (NF). However, innovative solutions are needed to improve the efficiency of UV photocatalytic reactors.

First, 0.6 g of polyacrylonitrile (PAN, (C3H3N)n, M w = 150 000) powders are dissolved into 5.0 g of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, C3H7NO, 99.5%) at 60 °C for 6 h. Second, 3.0 mmol of tin (II) 2-ethylhexanoate ((C8H15O2)2Sn, 95.0%), 2.0 mmol of titanium (IV) isopropoxide ((CH3CH3CHO)4Ti, 95.0%) and 0.3 g of acetylacetone (Hacac, C5H8O2, 99.0%) are dissolved into 1.0 g of DMF at room temperature for 20 min. Then, the obtained solutions are mixed together for electrospinning with a working voltage of 12 kV, in which aluminum foil is used as a collector. The collected nanofibers are pre-oxidized at 280 °C for 2 h in the air and sintered under the flowing of N2 at 500 °C for 2 h to successfully fabricate SnO2/TiO2@CNFs-1.5:1 samples. For comparison, precursor solutions with different mole ratios of SnO2 to TiO2 are prepared for electrospinning by just altering the content of (C8H15O2)2Sn in the latter precursor solution to 4 and 2 mmol to obtain the SnO2/TiO2@CNFs-2:1 and SnO2/TiO2@CNFs-1:1, respectively. As control groups, SnO2@CNFs and TiO2@CNFs are also synthesized with the same synthesis procedure as SnO2/TiO2@CNFs-1.5:1 except for the fact that the precursors in the latter solution are replaced with 4.0 mmol of (C8H15O2)2Sn and 4.0 mmol of (CH3CH3CHO)4Ti in the presence of 0.3 g of Hacac. 2.2 Materials characterization The crystal structure of the fibers is carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rint 2000) using a CuKα radiation. Field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Mira3, Tescan) attached with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) are used to characterize the morphology and elemental distributions. The surface morphology and microstructure of those samples are further observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM, 2100F). The composition and chemical states of the samples are conducted by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Thermo K-Alpha). The carbon structure are recorded on Raman spectra using Renishaw Invia Reflex with an excitation laser wavelength of 532 nm, and the carbon content is determined by thermogravimetric (TG, LABSYSEVO) tests in the air with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. 2.3 Electrochemical performance For the working electrode preparation, the ground composite nanofibers, conductive carbon black, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) powders are mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 to obtain a homogenous black slurry.

This product shows increased mesoporosity and uptake of N2 at 77 K and 1 bar of 1083 cm3/g, as compared to 615 cm3/g for the product made via the traditional batch approach. This leads to an increase working capacity due to the change in isotherm type, from type I to type IV, with the uptake occurring more gradually overall as pressure increases. An increased working capacity allows for a greater range of control for the volume of N2 stored in/released from the material.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental\nMaterials\nCerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3.6H2O, 99%), benzene-1, 4-dicarboxylate (terephthalic acid/C6H4(CO2H)2,99%), ethanol absolute (CH3CH2OH, 99.9%), hydrochloride acid (HCl,37%), sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃,99%), ammonia (NH3,25%), Ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (EDTA, 99%), benzoquinone (BQ, 99%), and isopropanol (IPA, 99%) were purchased from Merck Company, Germany. Analytical grade tetracycline hydrochloride was generously provided by Sinadarou Labs Company. Deionized water (DI) was used as the solvent.\nSynthesis of Ce-MOF\nTo optimize the Ce-MOF synthesis toward enhanced TC adsorption and photodegradation, different synthesis methods, namely RT, HT, and SC, were studied as outlined in Fig. 1.\nFigure 1\n(a) Chemical Structure of Ce-MOF (cerium benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate), (b) Crystalline structure of Ce-MOF55, and (c) Schematic of Ce-MOF synthesis routes.\nFull size image\nRoom temperature synthesis\nCe-MOF was synthesized at RT by adding 70 mg terephthalic acid as ligand to 50 mL DI under stirring. Ammonia solution (46 wt.%) was then gradually added to the solution to increase pH to 7. Afterward, 10 mL of 27.6 mM Ce(NO3)3 aqueous solution was gradually added to the solution, producing white Ce-MOF precipitates. The precipitate was stirred for 12 h to ensure uniform mixing. It was then collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min at RT. Ce-MOF precipitate was subsequently washed with DI and ethanol. Finally, it was dried at 60 °C for 24 h55.\nHydrothermal synthesis\nThe HT Ce-MOF synthesis is similar to RT synthesis. The only difference is that in the HT method, the final solution is placed in a high-pressure hydrothermal reactor. The reactor was then placed in an oven at 120 °C for 120 h56,57. Finally, the precipitate was collected, washed, and dried according to the RT synthesis procedure.\nSonochemical synthesis\nSC synthesis utilizes ultrasound irradiation. Herein, an appropriate amount of terephthalic acid was added to 50 mL of DI while stirring to achieve a final concentration of 7.4–11.4 mmol/L. Ammonia solution (46 wt.%) was gradually added to the solution to increase pH to 7. Then, an ultrasound probe (QSONICA, Q700) was placed in the solution at ambient conditions. 10 mL of Ce(NO3)3 aqueous solution was gradually added into the solution to achieve a final terephthalic acid to Ce(NO3)3 molar ratio equal to 1.5. Power output and US time were in the range of 45–65 amplitude and 30–180 min, respectively. The ligand concentration and US time/power were chosen as input parameters for the CCD. Finally, the precipitate was collected, washed, and dried according to the RT synthesis procedure.\nCe-MOF characterization\nFTIR Spectroscopy was performed in the range of 400–4000 cm-1. X-ray diffraction was conducted using graphite-monochromatic Cu Kα radiation at a wavelength of 1.54056 Å at 25 °C by Bruker Tensor II and Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with a scanning rate of 0.02°min-1 at 2θ = 10–80°. Sample morphology was obtained by TEM (Philips EM 208S) and FE-SEM (TESCAN; MIRA III) with an acceleration voltage of 100 keV. UV–vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were performed using Holmarc HO-SP-DRSP100 spectrophotometers at the wavelength (λmax) of 360 nm, which corresponds to the maximum UV absorption of TC. Zeta potential analysis was performed by Horiba SZ-100 at RT. Herein, 100 mg of Ce-MOF was dispersed in 100 mL DI using an ultrasound bath for 5 min. To determine the surface charge and locate the isoelectric point, suspensions with different pHs were prepared using 0.1 M solutions of HCl and NaOH. PL data were collected using a Varian Spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm under 325 nm excitation. Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical characteristic of Ce-MOF were determined using Metrohm Dropsens µstat-i400s instrument, employing the traditional three-electrode system to obtain Mott-Schottky, photocurrent and EIS analyses. In brief, 3 mg of Ce-MOF was dispersed in 10 μL DI and subjected to ultrasonication for 5 min. An Ag/AgCl electrode and a graphite wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A 0.2 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte for measurements.\nSonophotocatalytic TC degradation experiments\nSonophotocatalytic TC degradation assisted by Ce-MOF was performed in a batch sonophotocatalyst reactor. The irradiation source (UV-A light, OSRAM ULTRA-MED FDA 400W) was placed 10 cm away of the reaction solution. The experiments were conducted in a 50 mL glass beaker placed in the reactor at 25 °C. To enhance the mixing and aeration of the TC solution, the beaker was placed in an ultrasound bath (50W). Air was blown into the chamber to eliminate the lamp’s heating effect. The temperature of the ultrasound water bath was maintained at 298K by circulating its water content.\nTo establish TC adsorption–desorption equilibrium on the Ce-MOF photocatalyst, the dispersion was left at dark environment for 60 min. During the photocatalytic degradation experiment, up to 3 mL of the reaction mixture were extracted, centrifuged and filtered using a syringe filter (pore size < 0.22 μm) to eliminate Ce-MOF particles in the solution. The samples were subsequently analyzed using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer to determine their TC concentration. The removal efficiency was calculated using Eq. (1).\n$$\\% Removal efficiency=\\frac{({C}_{i}-{C}_{f})}{{C}_{i}}100$$\n (1) \nwhere, Ci and Cf are the initial and final concentrations of TC (mg L-1), respectively.\nExperimental design and optimization process\nExperimental design assists in identifying the interplay of essential parameters within specified ranges by minimum number of experiments. The subsequent analysis of response variance provides a suitable model that can be utilized to identify the optimum synthesis condition58. In this study the CCD RSM was employed to investigate the impact of ligand concentration and US time/power interplay on TC removal efficiency. Table S3 shows the effective parameters and their ranges. Table S4 shows conditions of different experiments.\nTrapping experiments\nTo investigate the impact of each active species on sonophotocatalytic activity of Ce-MOF, free radical trapping experiments were conducted. IPA, EDTA, and BQ were employed to quench h+, ⋅OH, and ⋅O2− during TC sonophotocatalytic degradation, respectively. The corresponding TC degradation experiments were conducted in an aqueous solution containing an initial TC concentration of 120 ppm, 1 g/L Ce-MOF, and 0.3 mM trapping agent at initial pH of 7.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Ce-MOF", "Syns_method": "room temperature synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "terephthalic acid", "amount": "70 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ce(NO3)3", "amount": "10 mL of 27.6 mM solution"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "Ce-MOF", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "terephthalic acid", "amount": "70 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ce(NO3)3", "amount": "10 mL of 27.6 mM solution"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "120 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "Ce-MOF", "Syns_method": "sonochemical synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "terephthalic acid", "amount": "7.4-11.4 mmol/L in 50 mL"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ce(NO3)3", "amount": "10 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ultrasonic", "parameters": {"time": "30-180 min"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "60 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}}}

Subsequently, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 363 K, 423 K, or 473 K for 12 h. After centrifugating and washing the suspension with hot deionized water several times, the final resultant powders were dried at 363 K overnight, and calcined at 923 K for 4 h with the increasing rate of 10 K/min under static air, giving the desired products of 3Ni/SiC-TK (T = 363, 423, and 473). 2.2 Catalyst characterization The characterizations including Specific Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas and the pore width distributions of the 3Ni/SiC-TK catalysts, X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Raman spectra, Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) and Thermogravimetry (TG) are described in the Supporting Information, as well as measurements of dielectric properties and microwave adsorption capabilities of the catalysts. 2.3 Catalytic activity test The conventional thermal catalytic DRM was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor, whereas the microwave catalytic DRM was performed in a microwave fixed-bed reactor with an input power of 200 W. Before the measurements, 50 mg catalyst was reduced by 25 % H2/N2 in a quartz tube reactor at 923 K for 1 h. Then a mixture of CH4/CO2/N2 with a molar ratio of 3/3/4 was introduced at 50 mL/min. DRM performance was measured from the set temperature of 923 K to 773 K. To monitor the actual temperature of catalyst powders, a K-type thermocouple was placed into the powders in conventional thermal catalytic DRM, while an optical fiber thermocouple was inserted to the powders in microwave catalytic DRM (Supporting Information Fig. S1). The outlet gas was online-analyzed by gas chromatography using a TCD detector. The stability tests of DRM were evaluated at the set temperature of 923 K for 50 h.

One of the reasons behind this is that the stability of MOFs is still unknown. Much attention has been devoted to the rational synthesis of novel MOFs, yet the predictability of MOF stability is so far limited. The present study compares the stability in a water environment with pH ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 of four zirconium-based MOFs constructed from ditopic, tritopic, and tetratopic linkers, namely UiO-66 (benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid), MOF-808 (benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid), MIP-200 (5,5′-methylenediisophthalic acid), and PCN-222 (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin).

It is clear that both MOFs based on tetratopic linkers are much more stable than UiO-66 and MOF-808 composed of di- and tritopic linkers, respectively. It should be noted that the kinetics of the linker release were also significantly slower for tetratopic linkers. At the same time, the connectivity of the Zr6 cluster did not play such an important role.

{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Due to their simplicity of manufacture, superior corrosion resistance, and low cost compared to platinum (Pt) electrodes, carbon-based counter electrodes (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), such as graphene composite (G), have attracted unprecedented interest in recent years. However, poor surface adhesion between the carbon counter electrodes (CCE) and the FTO substrate, as well as limited surface area and poor inter-particle connectivity between the carbon materials, have continuously proven to be a significant problem. To avoid these issues, we used a hydrothermal technique to fabricate G/Zn-Al-LDH as CE in DSSCs. The conversion of triiodide to iodide utilizing electrons flowing through an external circuit relies on CE so CE plays a crucial role in DSSCs. Enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and lowering the device's cost are two efficient ways to increase the performance of a CE. The prepared G/Zn-Al-LDH was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), surface area Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Tafel polarization test. G/Zn-Al-LDH was used as novel CE in DSSCs with TiO2 nanoparticles (TNP) as a working electrode, Eosin Y (EY) as photosensitizer, and LiI-I2 as a liquid electrolyte. The photovoltaic parameters were observed to be 0.66 V and 11.23 mA/cm2 for open circuit voltage (VOC) and short circuit current density (JSC), respectively for TNP/EY/LiI-I2/G/ZnAl-LDH system.

Lymphocytes were stained with an antibody cocktail (anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD44, and anti-CD62L) for 1 h in the dark and on ice. Cells were washed and flow cytometry was performed to determine the percent population of T eff cells.\nFemale BALB/c mice (n = 5) were vaccinated subcutaneously with three doses of 100 μL 0.1 M saline and 100 μL OVA (75 μg OVA total) on days 0, 7, and 14. Additionally, one dose of μ-OVA@ZIF (25 μg OVA) on day 0. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and blood was drawn weekly from day 14 until day 98. The serum was isolated by centrifuging blood samples at 1200 × g for 10 min to remove red blood cells. Serum was stored at −20 °C until further use.\n96-well Nunc titer plate was coated the night before with 100 μL 1 μg mL−1 OVA in coating buffer (0.05 M NaCO3 buffer pH 9.6). The plate was left to incubate overnight at 4 °C. Plate was washed 4× with 300 μL of wash buffer (0.1 M PBS 0.05% w/v tween-20 pH 7.4).

Absorbance was read at 450 nm at 15 and 30 min. The endpoint titer was determined by plotting the dilution factor against 450 nm absorbance. The logarithmic curve was fit, and the endpoint titer was determined by the intersection of logarithmic fit to the average baseline (saline).\nFemale BALB/c mice (n = 5) were vaccinated subcutaneously with three doses of 100 μL 0.1 M saline and 100 μL OVA (75 μg OVA total) on days 0, 7, and 14. Additionally, one dose of μ-OVA@ZIF (25 μg OVA) on day 0. Mice were anesthetized before vaccination. On day 21, mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation, and the ILN was extracted along with other major organs (heart, lung, liver, and kidney) for H&E staining. A single-cell suspension was obtained by carefully passing cells through a 100 μM cell strainer. Cells were washed 1× with 0.1 M PBS, resuspended in 1 mL of 0.1 M PBS, and counted using trypan blue to determine live/dead cells. Cells were stained with Zombie UV (1 : 2000) in 0.1 M PBS for 30 min on ice in the dark. Subsequently, the antibody cocktail (anti-mouse CD19 AF700, anti-mouse IgG1 PE, anti-mouse CD95 APC, and anti-mouse GL7 AF 488 in CSB) was added to the cells. The cells were left to stain for 30 minutes on ice in the dark. Cells were washed 3× with FACS buffer. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out on a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Material and methods The Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and TiCl4 (99.99%, Acros Organics) compounds were used as initial salts. All chemicals were purchased and used without further purification. Appropriate amount of cerium was dissolved in 500 ml distilled water containing of nitric acid (pH = 2) to give total concentrations of metals of 0.04 M. After dissolution, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP 35000) was added (the proportion of PVP was 1 wt% of the total mass of the mixture) and stirring was continued. Then, the co-precipitation was carried out by addition of aqueous ammonia at 30 °C under stirring to reach pH 11. Ultrasonic processing (10 min, 35 kHz, 150 W, Sapphire UZV-4.0) was used during dissolution of salts in distilled water and after precipitation. The resulting precipitates were filtered, washed with distilled water-ethanol solution (H2O/C2H5OH = 9 vol), dried at 150 °C for 12 h, and calcined in static air by heating at a rate of 4 °C/min from room temperature to 500 °C and kept at 500 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace. The obtained ceria powder was further used as the core. The synthesis of the core-shell structure was carried out as follows. First solution: PVP was dissolved in water, then ceria powder was sprinkled there and stirring was continued (at 30 °C with ultrasonic treatment). Second solution: titanium chloride was dissolved in isopropanol under the same preparation conditions as the first solution. Next, the second solution was added to the first solution, stirring was continued for 5 h at 30 °C (without ultrasonic treatment; the proportion of PVP was 1 wt% of the total mass of the mixture), then the temperature was raised to 80 °C, evaporating until a gel formed. One sample was subjected to hydrothermal treatment (120 °C, 5 h) instead of conventional mixing, while maintaining the remaining parameters and synthesis conditions. Drying and calcination were carried out similarly to obtaining the ceria core. The content of titania (and hence the calculation of the initial titanium chloride) was chosen from the following considerations: since the particle size of ceria is about 15 nm, conventionally titania should have a shell nominal thickness of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 nm. For the calculation, the density of ceria (7.21 g/cm3) and titania (3.81 g/cm3, anatase phase, since at 500 °C it is this phase that is generally formed) was chosen. For example, for the sample 1 (CeO2-10.1 wt% TiO2), it was performed as follows. 3.705 g of PVP was dissolved in 30 ml distilled water at 30 °C for 10 min, then 1.0 g of uncoated CeO2 nanoparticles were dispersed into this system and stirred for 20 min. This solution is referred as solution one. Solution two was prepared in parallel by dissolving of 0.16 ml TiCl4 in 50 ml isopropanol at 30 °C. The solution two was added to the first solution and the mixture was stirred for 5 h at 30 °C, then the temperature was raised to 80 °C, evaporating until a gel formed. The solutions one and two were subjected to ultrasonic treatment, and after their mixing, the treatment was stopped. All powders were characterized by XRD (DRON-3M, CuKα radiation), HR TEM (FEI Osiris), nitrogen sorption (TriStar 3000 Micromeritics, BET-BJH at 77K), TG-DSC-MS (Netzsch STA449F3). A transmission electron microscope was used to observe the morphology of particles. The samples were deposited onto carbon-coated copper grids. The crystallinities and phase analysis of the samples were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis using a powder diffractometer. The XRD patterns were taken in the 2θ range of 20–110° at a scan speed of 1° min−1. N2 adsorption-desorption measurement was performed. The sample was degassed at 150 °C for 3 h in vacuum. The specific surface area was calculated by BET method. The pore volume and pore diameter were obtained by the BJH method from the desorption isotherms. The evaluation of the process of formation of the structure was carried out by the thermogravimetric method in the range of 20–1000 °C at 10 °C/min in air.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "CeO2-TiO2", "Syns_method": "core-shell co-precipitation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "PVP 35000", "amount": "3.705 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "CeO2", "amount": "1.0 g"}, "prc3": {"name": "TiCl4", "amount": "0.16 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "30 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "C3H8O", "amount": "50 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "stir", "parameters": {"temperature": "30 °C", "time": "5 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "until gel formed"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "hydrothermal treatment", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "5 h"}}, "post_proc4": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "150 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc5": {"step": "calcine", "parameters": {"temperature": "500 °C", "time": "1 h"}}}}}}}

The microstructure of the nanocomposites, along with the size and distribution of in-situ TiB2 particles within the brake disc was characterized using an optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The nanocomposites exhibited fine α-Al phases, eutectic Si needles and clusters of TiB2 particles. The addition of TiB2 particles changed the dendritic structure of the α-Al phase into the cellular structure. The TEM analysis confirmed the presence of nano-sized TiB2 particles and their clusters within the matrix and eutectic regions. Notably, there were no significant variations in the volume fraction of TiB2 from the inner to outer regions of the disc. As a result, a slight decrease in the hardness was noticed from the outer to inner periphery along the radial direction of the disc. Tensile and compressive strength was increased with TiB2 content upto 3 wt%, similarly trend was observed in the wear rate of the composites. However, a decrease in mechanical properties was observed in the 4 wt% TiB2 composites, likely due to the presence of large TiB2 agglomerates and their debonding from the matrix during the testing.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "A356-xTiB2 (x=1, 2, 3, 4 wt%)", "application": "brake discs", "props": {}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals Carbide slag (Yuanheng Water Purification Material Factory, Gongyi); squaric acid (C4H2O4, Leyan); methanol (CH3OH, Aladdin); tetraethylenepentamine (C8H23N5, Aladdin) were purchased without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of UTSA-280-x-y UTSA-280-x-y was prepared by mixing carbide slag (20 mmol, 1.481 g), squaric acid (20 mmol, 2.281 g) and different amounts of water (100 mmol, 1.8 mL; 200 mmol, 3.6 mL; 300 mmol, 5.4 mL; 400 mmol, 7.2 mL; 500 mmol, 9 mL) at a ratio of 1:1, and grinding them for 30 min in a ball mill at different frequencies (10 HZ; 15 HZ; 20 HZ; 25 HZ; 30 HZ), where x and y represented the water content and ball milling frequency, respectively. The fixed ball milling frequency was 25 HZ when varying the added water content (UTSA-280-x-25). The solid powder was dried in a vacuum oven at 105 °C for 12 h, and then 2.9 g of light grey powder was obtained. 2.3 Synthesis of UTSA-280–300-15-zTEPA UTSA-280–300-15-zTEPA was carried out by the wet impregnation method. Different contents of TEPA (10–50 %) were added to 14 mL of methanol with stirring at room temperature for 30 min. Then, 1.5 g of UTSA-280–300-15 was slowly added to the different concentrations of amine solution under stirring, and the resulting mixture was mixed for 12 h. The precipitate was filtered and then washed with methanol three times to eliminate any remaining unreacted amine. Finally, the washed material was dried at 60 °C for 6 h, resulting in the amine-functionalized UTSA-280–300-15-zTEPA material, where z represented TEPA concentration. 2.4 Characterization The chemical compositions of carbide slag were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF, ZSX Primus 2, Rigaku, Japan). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT600, USA) was performed under a 100 mL/min N2 atmosphere with temperature increase at 10 °C/min from room temperature to 600 °C. The chemical structure of functional groups and chemical bonds in the samples was examined using Fourier transform infrared Raman spectrometry (FTIR, Frontier Mid-IR, USA). The FTIR analysis utilized a wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1 and a resolution of 4 cm−1. The morphology and average particle size of the sample were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The prepared adsorbent is degassed in a vacuum at 110 °C for 24 h. The adsorption/desorption of CO2 was measured to determine the Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET) surface area using a specific surface area and pore size analyzer at 195 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2460, USA). The crystal phases were analyzed for the prepared adsorbents using a powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) instrument equipped with Cu Kα radiation (Rigaku Smart lab, Japan). The initial scattering angle ranged from 5° to 50°, and the scanning speed was set at 10°/min. 2.5 CO2 adsorption tests CO2 adsorption tests were carried out in a fixed-bed (outer diameter of 25 mm, length of 90 cm) coupled to an on-line gas analyzer. 500 mg of MOF was subjected to N2 flow (100 mL/min) at 110 °C for 30 min to eliminate water and any adsorbed gases. After that, the temperature was then lowered to 25 °C, and a mixture of 15 % CO2 and 85 % N2 was switched. The desorption test was performed at 110 °C for 30 min using a 100 mL/min stream of pure N2. The adsorption/desorption cycle was repeated 10 times for the UTSA-280–300-15-40TEPA to evaluate the cyclic stability. The CO2 adsorption capacity was calculated by analyzing the breakthrough curves according to Eq. (1) : (1) q = 44 F C 0 22.4 m ∫ 0 t 1 - C C 0 d t where F is the gas flow rate (mL/min), m is the mass of the adsorbent (g), and C0 and C refer to the gas composition at the inlet and outlet respectively (in vol%). 2.6 Kinetic models Pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and Avrami models were employed to evaluate the CO2 adsorption kinetics of different amine-functionalized adsorbents. The pseudo-first order kinetic model (Eq. (2) ) is used to predicate the physical adsorption of CO2 on the adsorbents and is particularly suitable for representing reversible interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate. The pseudo-second order kinetic model (Eq. (3) ) is favorable for predicting the chemisorption behavior of CO2 on the adsorbent, which assumes a linear relationship between the amount of adsorption and the squared number of available active sites on the adsorbent. Avrami (Eq. (4) ) is a fractional-order kinetic model.

Ltd. WBFS were prepared by Hebei Iron and Steel Group. Table 1 lists its compositions and basic physical and chemical properties. 2.2 Material preparation 2.2.1 Surface etching of WBFS WBFS with the size range from 100 to 150 mesh were immersed in 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid for 2 min. Then, filtered out, placed in a beaker filled with distilled water and ultrasonically cleaned for 20 min. Finally, the WBFS were dried in an oven at 100 °C for 2 h. 2.2.2 Preparation of TiO2/WBFS TiO2/WBSF: 28 mL absolute ethanol was placed in beaker A. 4 mL of tetrabutyl titanate and 0.3 mL of acetylacetone were added in sequence using a pipette and mixed under magnetic stirring to obtain the solution A. Another 14 mL of absolute ethanol was placed in beaker B. 2.0 mL of deionised water and 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid were introduced and mixed well under magnetic stirring to obtain solution B. Then, solution B was added dropwise to solution An under strong stirring to obtain a stable, transparent, and light yellow TiO2 sol. The surface etched WBSF was soaked in TiO2 sol, vacuum-filtered, dried, and calcined in muffle furnace at set temperature for 2 h to gain TiO2/WBSF photocatalytic material. The schematic diagram of the preparation process was shown in Fig. 2 . The remaining solution was conducted the same calcination regime to obtain TiO2 powder. 2.2.3 Preparation of Fe–TiO2/WBFS 28 mL absolute ethanol was used as the solvent, 4 mL tetrabutyl titanate and 0.3 mL acetylacetone were added in sequence and stirred thoroughly to obtain solution A. Another 14 mL anhydrous ethanol and 2.0 mL distilled water were mixed, and 1 mL HCl was added to adjust the pH value. After that, iron nitrate nine water according to a certain molar ratio of iron and titanium was added to obtain solution B. The solution B was dropped slowly into solution A and stirred for 30 min. Then, the pretreated WBFS was placed in the prepared solution for 5 min, dried, and calcined in a muffle furnace at set temperature, thereby obtaining Fe–TiO2/WBFS photocatalytic material, as shown in Fig. 2. This loading cycle was completed to conduct the investigation on the influence of the loading numbers on photocatalyst. The remaining solution was conducted the same calcination regime to obtain Fe–TiO2 powder. 2.3 Characterization Thermogravimetry/differential thermal analyser (TG-DSC) was employed to investigate the physical and chemical behavior during the formation of TiO2.

X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was used to consider the crystal phase of samples with the 2-theta being between 10° and 80°. The average size of grains was figured out from the X-ray diffractograms with the Scherrer formula [20,38]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was adopted to examine the microstructure of WBFS and the photocatalytic composite. a nitrogen adsorption-desorption apparatus was employed to analysis the specific surface area of samples through the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. A UV–Vis spectrophotometer was used to monitor the absorption spectrum in the wavelength range of 220–800 nm, and BaSO4 was selected as the reference substance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyse the elemental species and valence states. The photoluminescence spectra were measured by a Fluorescence spectrophotometer. 2.4 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activity of samples was characterized through the degradation rate of MB aqueous solution. 50 mL of 10 mg⋅L−1 MB aqueous solution, 0.3 g of the photocatalyst, and a magnetic stirring bar were mixed in a high-purity quartz test tube and placed in a photoreaction apparatus. The magnetic stirring process was conducted for 30 min without illumination to ensure an adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Subsequently, the photodegradation experiments were performed in a sealed photoreaction apparatus for 3 h under ultraviolet light. During the photocatalytic reaction, 10 mL of solution were sampled at 30-min intervals and centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm. Then, the supernatant was extracted and conducted the concentration test using a 723N-type UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 664 nm (according to the absorption spectrum of MB solution in Fig. 3 , showing the strongest absorption peak at 664 nm for MB), which was used to calculate the degradation ratio of MB according to the Lambert-Beer Law (Eq.

The objective of this study is synthesizing an rGO-like carbon (C) compound from coconut shells and inserting into LiFePO4 (LFP), as Li-ion battery cathode. Thus, an LFP/rGO nanocomposite was successfully fabricated using an unconventional approach which is the combination of the sol–gel technique and mechanical ultracentrifugation. LiFePO4 precursors were prepared from commercial starting materials, using the sol–gel technique, and the composites’ carbon weight content was varied between 15 and 30%. This process was subsequently followed by evaluating the microstructural characteristics and electrochemical properties as cathode for the Li-ion batteries. The results showed a high tendency of achieving maximum efficiency with merged LFP and rGO, although LFP molecules appear scattered but are firmly attached to each rGO structure, acting as a \"bridge\" between the surrounding particles. This reduced graphene oxide (rGO) link is relatively effective in limiting LFP grain growth as well as expanding the surface area, leading to a declined Li-ion diffusion rate. Consequently, the bridge presence also demonstrated a significant effect by enhancing the conductivity, electrical capacity, and performance of the LFP/rGO cycle than pure LFP. Furthermore, the percentage ratio of the synthesized LFP/rGO cathode (85:15) attained higher cycle capacity, compared to 70:30 on the level of 0.1 C, with specific discharging average of 128.03 mAhg−1 and retention capacity of 97.75% after 50 cycles, at room temperature and a rate of 0.1 C.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "LFP/rGO (85:15)", "application": "Li-ion battery cathode", "props": {"specific_capacity": "128.03 mAh/g @ 0.1 C", "capacity_retention": "97.75% after 50 cycles @ 0.1 C"}}, "MAT2": {"name": "LFP/rGO (70:30)", "application": "Li-ion battery cathode", "props": {}}}}

The LE (A) became a transparent GPE (A) with the polymerization of DOL to form PDXL after 24 hours at 25 °C.28\nThe IPN-GPE was prepared with LE (B), i.e. 5 wt% PVA-CN in LE (A). The LE (B) became a transparent GPE (B) with the polymerization of DOL to form PDXL after 24 hours at 25 °C. Then, the obtained GPE was heated at 70 °C, which became a black IPN-GPE with the cross-linking of PVA-CN after 6 hours.\nCross-linked PVA-CN was separated and purified from the IPN-GPE with the method in ref. 38. The IPN-GPE was first washed with ethanol to remove Li salts, DME and unreacted monomers. Then, the precipitate was dried to obtain a polymer matrix composed of cross-linked PVA-CN and PDXL, which was washed several times with acetone to remove PDXL. The obtained precipitate after being dried was the cross-linked PVA-CN.\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Vertex 70 instrument at 25 °C.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Experimental\nMaterials characterization\nThe following materials were adopted in this study:\nGround granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS), a precursor for aluminum-silicates that is rich in calcium, was used. It was originated from an iron and steel factory in Helwan, Egypt. It has a 2883 cm2/g Blaine-specific surface area.\nThe crushed basalt came from the Shuq El-Thouban, Egypt. It was ground and sieved to particles with a Blaine surface area of 2643 cm2/g and particle size of ≤ 45-mm basalt waste (BW).\nFigure 1 shows XRD patterns of BW and GGBFS and BW as determined by XRD instrument (model Xpert-2000, Philips), whereas Table 1 presents the mineralogical oxide compositions of BW and GGBFS as determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF, model PW-1400, Xios).\nA significant hump can be observed in the X-ray diffractograms of GGBFS between 2θ = 23–36°, which is connected to material’s amorphous nature, whereas XRD patterns for BW reveal distinct peaks for quartz (SiO2) at 2θ = 22.8, 26.3, 29.0, 37.0, 39.9, and 41.0° (PDF: 00–005-0490); illite at 2θ = 28.6, 31.1, 33.2, 35.6, 41.0, and 42.8° (PDF: 00–001-0614); and calcite at 2θ = 30.1, 43.0, and 48.1° (PDF: 01–088-1808) [33]. The TS25 standard, which designates the pozzolanic material, is applicable to BW based on the chemical oxide percent data presented in Table 1. The TS25 standard assumes that the summation of SiO2 + Al2O3 + Fe2O3 wt.% should be ≥ 70%, Cl− content ≤ 1%, SO3 content ≤ 3%, and the reactive silica content not less than 25% [42].\nAlkaline activators which include sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicate (Na2Si2O3) were purchased commercially from Al-Salam Association, 6 October District, Egypt. The dry mix of GP was supplemented with 5 and 10 wt.% of NaOH and Na2Si2O3, respectively, from the weight of the mix and one-part mix [9, 10].\nNano-TiO2 (NT) with a purity of 99% and density of 0.04–0.06 g/ml was delivered from Al-Salam Association, 6 October District, Egypt. Surface characteristics of NT were examined via interpreting N2-adsorption/desorption isotherm 77 °K (Fig. 2a, b).\nFig. 1\nXRD patterns of a basalt and b GGBFS\nFull size image\nTable 1 Chemical oxide composition of the raw materials\nFull size table\nFig. 2\na Adsorption–desorption isotherm, b BJH curve, and c & d SEM images of NT\nFull size image\nThe adsorption/desorption isotherm of nano-TiO2 (NT) is identified as a type 2 with a small H1 hysteresis loop according to IUPAC classifications. As shown by the monolayer capacity (Vm) of 2.0 cm3/g and the average pore diameter of 28.29 nm, the pores in NT are in the meso/micro range. Additionally, the total pore volume (Vp) was determined to be 0.0616 cm3/g, and the BET surface area (SBET) for nano-TiO2 was estimated to be 87.15 m2/g. On the other hand, Fig. 2b shows Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) curve of pore size distribution by volume for NT. The majority of the NT pores are evidenced to be mesopores according to the data of Fig. 2b, where dpmax = 40 nm. SEM micrographs of nano-TiO2 illustrated in Fig. 2c reveal that the NT particles are extremely tiny and spherical, with a consistent size distribution and a diameter that varied from 20 to 80 nm.\nGP mix design\nAlong with the TiO2 nanoparticles, two precursors were used in the current investigation. Various dry blends were developed by substituting GGBFS by 0, 20, 40, and 60 wt.% BW. The solid alkaline activators were added to the dry blend at a rate of 15 wt.% (5% NaOH, 10% Na2Si2O3) of the total mass. To guarantee the homogeneity of the mix, each dry mix (containing the dry raw precursors and the solid activators) was stirred for 6 h in a porcelain ball mill. Designation and composition of the examined dry mixes are disclosed in Table 2.\nTable 2 Mixes notation and their composition\nFull size table\nEach dry mix was mixed with water to create geopolymer pastes. All of the created pastes had the same consistency, suggesting that substituting BW for GGBFS did not affect the workability of GP paste as well as the water/solid (W/S) ratio necessary for standard consistency. To assure the uniform distribution of the nanoparticles in the mixing water within the pastes containing nano-TiO2, they were initially suspended in a mixture of water along with 3 wt.% superplasticizer, and the suspension was sonicated by ultrasonic homogenizer (LUHS0A12, 650W, 220 V/50HZ) for 1 h [43]. To begin the geopolymerization processes, the dry mixes were combined with water, and the resulting pastes were molded into cubic specimens utilizing one-inch cubic molds and kept overnight at RH≈98 ± 2%.\nThe hardened cubic specimens were taken out of the molds after 24 h and were cured under humid conditions (≥ 99%) to retain the geopolymerization processes [44].\nTesting routine\nAccording to ASTM C191, the Vicat apparatus was used to measure the initial and final setting times for all the freshly developed geopolymer pastes [41]. This apparatus comprises a frame that contains a mobile rod, equipped with a disc at one side and a needle that can be affixed at the opposite end.\nCompressive strength tests were done using a Ton Industrial Machine (West Germany) for maximum load of 60 tons. The test was performed on three cubic specimens, for each geopolymer mix, after 3, 14, 28, and 90 days to monitor the strength that had evolved, according to ASTM C109 M16-a [13, 45].\nAfter 3 and 28 days of curing, total porosity (P, %) and bulk density (BD, g/cm3) were performed by measuring the following weights of the hardened cube that represent each GP mix: the weight of the cube suspended in air (saturated surface dry) (W1), its weight immersed in water (W2), and then the weight of the cube after drying at 100 °C for about 24 h (W3). Bulk density and total porosity were calculated using formulae 1 and 2:\nB\nu\nl\nk\n \nd\ne\nn\ns\ni\nt\ny\n(\nB\n.\nD\n)\n=\nW\n1\nW\n1\n−\nW\n2\n (1) \nP\no\nr\no\ns\ni\nt\ny\n(\nP\n%\n)\n=\nW\n1\n−\nW\n3\nW\n1\n−\nW\n2\n (2) \nDurability tests\nFire resistance\nThe thermal resistance test was performed on the 28-day cured samples. Three cubes which represent each GP mix were dried in an oven at 90 °C overnight. They were then fired for 3 h at temperatures of 250, 500, and 750 °C in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 10 °C per minute. The burned specimens were tested for compressive strength after being cooled progressively to room temperature in desiccators. Applying Eq. 3, residual strength (RS)t was evaluated.\n(\nR\nS\n)\nt\n=\n(\nC\n.\nS\n)\nt\n(\nC\n.\nS\n.\n)\n0\n×\n100\n (3) \n(C.S)t: Compressive strength after firing.\n(C.S)0: Compressive strength after 28-day hydration.\nSulfate attack test\nThree cubes for each GP mix, after hydration for 28 days, were submerging in MgSO4 solution (7%) for up to 4 months, to evaluate the detrimental effects of sulfate ions penetration. Samples were removed after 1, 2, and 4 months of curing in sulfate solution, and their compressive strength was evaluated, and the average value was adopted.\nIrradiation by γ-rays\nResistance of GP mixes to irradiation of γ-rays was tested by exposing the dried 28-day samples to a gamma-ray source (Co60, dose rate 985 kGy/h) applying 500, 1000, and 1500 kGy with a dosing rate 1.4 kGy/h. After irradiating the samples, the compressive strength test was assigned after the sample had been exposed to radiation, and the residual strengths (RS %)rad were determined using Eq. 4:\n(\nR\nS\n%\n)\nr\na\nd\n=\n(\nC\nS\n)\nr\na\nd\n(\nC\nS\n)\n0\n×\n100\n (4) \nWhere CSrad is the compressive strength after radiation given dosage of γ-ray, CS0 is the compressive strength prior to radiation (28-day value).\nPhase composition and microstructure\nGP phases that developed during the hydration of the various geopolymer specimens were identified using XRD and thermogravimetric techniques. XRD was performed using cobalt target (λ = 0.17889 nm) and filter made of nickel under 40 kV and 40 mA. The scanning range spanned from 5 to 60 (2θ°), with a scanning speed of 1 s/step and a resolution of 0.02/step. TGA test was done using TGA:TA instrument, model SDT Q600. A nitrogen environment was maintained while heating 15 mg of powdered sample (≤ 25 µm) in the temperature range of 50 to 1000 °C, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The microstructure of various GP samples was explored using SEM-Quanta 250 FEG equipment.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Geopolymer (GP) with nano-TiO2", "Syns_method": "alkaline activation", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "GGBFS", "amount": "variable wt%"}, "prc2": {"name": "basalt waste (BW)", "amount": "0, 20, 40, 60 wt%"}, "prc3": {"name": "nano-TiO2 (NT)", "amount": "not specified"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "variable for W/S ratio"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ultrasonic homogenization", "parameters": {"time": "1 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "cure", "parameters": {"temperature": "room temperature", "humidity": "≥99%", "duration": "90 days"}}}}}}}
{"instruction": "Extract the following abstract text:", "input": "Abstract\nThe most promising candidate as an everyday alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). This is not only due to Na abundance, but also because the main principles and cell structure are very similar to LIBs. Due to these benefits, NIBs are expected to be used in applications related to large-scale energy storage systems and other applications not requiring top-performance in terms of volumetric capacity. One important issue that has hindered the large scale application of NIBs is the anode material. Graphite and silicon, which have been widely applied as anodes in NIBs, do not show great performance. Hard carbons look very promising in terms of their abundance and low cost, but they tend to suffer from instability, in particular over the long term. In this work we explore a carbon-coated TiO2 nanoparticle system that looks very promising in terms of stability, abundance, low-cost, and most importantly that safety of the cell, since it does not suffer from potential sodium plating during cycling. Maintaining a nano-size and consistent morphology of the active material is a crucial parameter for maintaining a well-functioning cell upon cycling. In this work we applied Anomalous Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (ASAXS) for the first time at the Ti K-edge of TiO2 anatase nanoparticles on different cycled composite electrodes in order to have a complete morphological overview of the modifications induced by sodiation and desodiation. This work also demonstrates for the first time that the nanosize of the TiO2 is maintained upon cycling, which is in agreement with the electrochemical stability.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "carbon-coated TiO2 nanoparticles", "application": "anode material for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs)", "props": {}}, "MAT2": {"name": "graphite", "application": "anode material in lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries", "props": {}}, "MAT3": {"name": "silicon", "application": "anode material in sodium-ion batteries", "props": {}}, "MAT4": {"name": "hard carbons", "application": "anode material for sodium-ion batteries", "props": {}}}}

However, SEI between the lithium metal anode and liquid electrolyte is usually unstable due to nonuniform Li deposition. A stable SEI is considered to be an effective way to control the interfacial structure and improve the stability of lithium metal anodes. Herein, an in situ-formed flexible three-dimensional honeycomb-like poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate) film (PTFEMA) fabricated by cross-linking lithium nitrate was designed to construct a LiF/Li3N-enriched hybrid organic–inorganic interphase. The predominant species in the hybrid organic–inorganic interphase should possess excellent chemical stability against the Li metal anode in theory according to the calculation results of the higher LUMO energy level and larger LUMO–HOMO gap, which can regulate uniform Li deposition and the growth of large crystalline grains of Li. As a result, the hybrid organic–inorganic interphase achieved excellent reversibility (>98% Coulombic efficiency over 400 cycles) and an ultralow overpotential (about 10 mV) over 1000 h. Meanwhile, the LFP cathode with the developed anode achieved an 89.6% capacity retention after 500 cycles even at a high rate of 10 C.

The spent graphite (SG) was mixed with the same mass of concentrated sulfuric acid and 10 % of total mass deionized water in a beaker for stirring 10 min, and then the mixed materials were roasted in muffle furnace at 200 ℃ for 2 h. Then the cured graphite was leached in a solution of sulfuric acid with 200 g·L-1 (stirring speed 300 r·min−1, 4 h, 90 ℃). After filtration, the leaching residue was washed with deionized water for several times, and the pH value of washed water was constantly checked until the pH was close to 7.0. Then, the filtration residue was dried in a drying oven at 80 °C for 8 h, and the purified graphite (PG) was obtained. The chemical compositions of spent and purified graphite were listed in Table S1. 10.00 g purified graphite was placed in a quartz crucible (50 × 50 × 50 mm) and then placed in a box-type microwave high temperature reactor (MW-HS-06, Electromechanical Factory of Kunming University of Science and Technology, China). The Armored K-type thermocouple (composed of thermocouple wire, insulation material and metal protective sleeve) was inserted into graphite to measure the temperature. It was heated to a certain temperature (600–900 ℃) and kept for a certain time (1–3 h). Conventional heating was carried out in a tubular resistance furnace (BLMT-GC, Luoyang Bolaimante, China). 2.2 Characterizations and electrochemical tests The composition of metal impurities was tested via an inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES, Optima 7000 DV, Perkin Elmer Instruments, US). The crystal structure of the samples was tested by X-ray diffraction (Ultima IV, Japan) at a scanning speed of 5°·min−1 and output rating of 3 kW. Fourier transform infrared spectra was obtained by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific Nicolet IS50, America). The morphology of the graphite particles was characterized by SEM (SUPRA55, ZEISS, Germany). The anode pastes were prepared by mixing different graphite samples, acetylene black (AB) and binder (PVDF/NMP, mass ratio was 5:95) with a weight ratio of 93:2:5. The active material and acetylene black were mixed in an agate mortar for 30 min and then the binder was added.

Remove the electrode and put the electrode into the glove box immediately (water content and oxygen content were less than 0.01 ppm). The electrode material was assembled into 2016-type button battery in the glove box filled with argon, wherein lithium was used as the opposite electrode. The electrolyte component was 1 M LiPF6 solution in EC/DMC/EMC solvent (1:1:1 in volume). The button battery was put into the 25 ℃ incubator for 10 h, and then the constant current charge–discharge test and rate capacity test were carried out on the Blue battery test system (CT 2001 A, LANHE, China).

The proposed approach is based on feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) model called a multilayer perceptron (MLP), trained by an optimized algorithm known as crow search algorithm (CSA). ANN is an effective and widely used approach for the prediction of extremely complex problems. Various studies have been proposed to improve the weight training of ANN using metaheuristic algorithms. CSA is a latest and an effective metaheuristic method relies on the intelligent behavior of crows. CSA has been never proposed to improve the weight training of ANN. Therefore, CSA is adopted to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of the ANN model, in order to improve the training accuracy and prediction performance of functional properties of TiO2 NPs coated cotton composites. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm i.e., multilayer perceptron with crow search algorithm (MLP-CSA) was applied to map out the complex input–output conditions to predict the optimal results. The amount of chemicals and reaction time were selected as input variables and the amount of titanium dioxide coated on cotton, self-cleaning efficiency, antimicrobial efficiency and UPF were evaluated as output results.

Enormously increasing industrial sectors such as textile dyes, pigments, ink, polymers, plastics, medicine and cosmetics effluent discharges are the main contributors toward the depleting water reservoir qualities. Which potentially have toxic effect on the organism depending on it that also includes humans too. Many of them are destruction resistant by conventional degradation methods. Thus, optimization of photocatalytic degradation methods has proven a new era in global water pollution remediation and cleaning related fields. Photocatalysts are considered as a great potential, economical, eco-friendly, sustainable and show promising role in water remediation of wastewater without generating secondary waste. However, the development of such an advanced system in large scale is still in the optimization phase. The design and development of efficiency, photocatalyst with optimum operational parameters, configuration and integration of photocatalysis is still need to be provoked generously. This chapter will be emphasized on the mechanism and diversifying factors influencing on photocatalysis degradation that should be taken into consideration during optimization and development of the photocatalysis system depending upon the load of the organic and inorganic contaminants. Various electromagnetic spectrum-based excitable nanoparticles or nanomaterials have been studied as photocatalyst that potentially degrade the contaminants from water. TiO2, Fe2O3, CuO, ZnO, CdS, SnO2, ZnS, etc. were extensively studied for the efficiency controlled optimizing factors in the degradation of pollutants. Optimization of Influencing factors and their effect on photocatalytic degradation activity of the photocatalyst on organic and inorganic water pollutants will be the point of convergence of this chapter. Within this frame of reference surface area, morphology of photocatalyst, higher light intensity, presence of oxidant and doping agents were perceived to be effective toward photocatalytic activity.

The ALD process was conducted at 150 °C in Picosun SUNALE™ R-200B ALD system. The ZnS ALD was conducted using diethyl zinc (DEZ, 6 N, Nanjing ai mou yuan Scientific equipment Co., Ltd.) and hydrogen sulphide gas (H2S, 10% in N2). DEZ was kept at room temperature (RT). High purity N2 (5 N) was adopted as carrier/purging gas for both precursors. 100 cycles of ZnS were deposited on MWCNTs, where one cycle was consist of 2 s DEZ dose, 12 s N2 purging, 5 s H2S dose, and 15 s N2 purging. The growth per cycle (GPC) of ZnS in our ALD system is ~ 0.11 nm [29]. Before ALD ZnS deposition, the MWCNTs powders were baked at 80 °C for 12 h in vacuum to remove the absorbed water, so as to avoid CVD like reaction between water and DEZ during ALD process. Subsequently, MWCNTs supports were loaded in a particular powders holder with porous mesh in ALD chamber, which has been described in our previous works [46, 47].\nMaterials characterizations\nZEISS Ultra 55 FESEM and FEI Tecnai F20 S-Twin TEM were employed to characterized the surface morphology and microstructures. Crystallinity was detected by Rigaku-D/MAX 2000 XRD using Cu Kα X ray. XPS (Thermo Fisher K-Alpha) with Al Kα X ray (1486.7 eV) was adopted to explore the surface chemical composition. The XPS binding energies was calibrated using the signal of C–C bonds from MWCNTs, where C 1s of C–C bonds is located at 284.6 eV. The ZnS content in MWCNTs@ZnS composite was measured using TGA (Netzsch STA 409PC/PG). The sample was heated in air from RT to 750 °C at the rate of 10 °C per min.\nElectrochemical tests\nCR2032 type coin cells were used to evaluate the electrochemical performances in this work. These cells adopted Li metal foil as counter/reference electrode and Celgard 2400 porous membrane as separator. 1 M LiPF6 in the solvent of ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC = 1:1 by vol) served as liquid electrolyte. The slurry was prepared by mixing MWCNTs@ZnS composite with carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) with the mass ratio of 8:1:1. Then, the electrode was fabricated by coating the slurry on Cu foil using doctor blade. The electrode was dried in vacuum for 8 h at 70 °C. Finally, the samples were punched into circular shape with 10 mm in diameter. The average weight of MWCNTs@ZnS composite is ~ 0.9 mg cm−2. The coin cells were assembled in Ar-filled glovebox, where both O2 and H2O contents are bellow 1 ppm. The CV curves were measured by CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. The tests were performed between 0 and 3 V with the scanning rate of 0.3 mV s−1. The cells were galvanostatically discharged/charged at 100 mA g−1 between 0.05 and 2.5 V by LAND CT2001A battery testing system. And the rate performances were measured at various current densities from 100 to 1000 mA g−1. The capacity of the electrodes were calculated according to whole mass of MWCNTs@ZnS composite. EIS was performed between 0.01 and 105 Hz using CHI660E electrochemical workstation, where 5 mV AC voltage amplitude was applied on the open circuit voltage. The electrochemical properties of commercial ZnS powders and pristine MWCNTs were also explored for comparison. The commercial ZnS powders exhibit the rodlike morphology with the size of 75 nm in width and 600 nm in length.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "MWCNTs@ZnS", "Syns_method": "ALD", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "MWCNTs"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "bake", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "12 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "ALD deposition", "parameters": {"temperature": "150 °C", "cycles": "100"}}}}}}}

SMX and ANT were used as model contaminants and sodium sulphate anhydrous (Na2SO4) as electrolyte. For the determination of specific reactive oxygen species (ROS), tert-butanol (TBA, ≥99%), furfural (FFA, 99%) and p-benzoquinone (PBQ, ≥98%) were used. All these reagents were supplied by Sigma Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). 2.2 Synthesis of Fe-MOF nanofiber membrane To carry out the Fe-MOF synthesis, the procedure indicated in the study by Fu et al. (2022) was followed with slight modifications. Its immobilization was conducted using the electrospinning technique (Fdez-Sanromán et al., 2023a). Initially, 0.8 g of PAN were homogeneously dissolved with 10 mL of DMF for 4 h at 70 °C. Subsequently, 0.1 g of Fe-MOF were mixed for 12 h until complete homogenization (Figure SM1). 2.3 Characterization of the Fe-MOF nanofiber membrane The surface characterization of the catalyst and synthesized nanofibers was performed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS) using a JEOL JSM6010LA with EDS Oxford AZtecOne SEM and a JEOL JEM-1010 (100 kV). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. Finally, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (Ks Analytical Systems, United States).

All solutions used in the experiments had a concentration of 10 mM of Na2SO4 to improve their conductivity. Fe-MOF nanofiber was only added in electro-Fenton tests. The amount of Fe-MOF nanofiber used in each test was 0.10 g and was placed between both electrodes. Moreover, in the electro-Fenton the aeration was supplied by a tank pump (APS300, Tetra), maintaining a constant flow rate of 0.5 L/min. Samples were collected during the experiment to determine the progress of drug elimination. All the results are the average of duplicated assays, and the standard deviations were below 5%. 2.4.2 Continuous system setup Figure SM2 shows a diagram with the numbered elements of the corresponding assembly for the continuous test. The electrochemical cell was similar that described in batch procedure. The flow rate was established to operate at two residence time of the polluted water, 3.35 and 8.5 h. 2.4.3 Scavengers assays The effects of ROS on drug degradation were determined to better understand its mechanism. To do that, performing masking experiments, in the same working conditions as descripted in section 2.4.1 . and 25 mA. TBA (50 mM), FFA (50 mM) and PBQ (10 mM) were used because they react with hydroxyl (HO·), singlet (1O2) and hydroxyl, and superoxide (O2 ·-), respectively. 2.5 Analytical procedures 2.5.1 HPLC determination The concentration of drugs, carboxylic acids and phenols were determined with HPLC Agilent 1260 equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C8, Rezex™ ROA-Organic Acid H+ and Synergi™ Polar-RP 80 Å columns, respectively. The detector used was a Diode Array Detector operating at 263 nm for SMX, 242 nm for ANT and 210 nm for carboxylic acids.

Here in, we report the applicability of low-temperature preparation of TiO2 photoanodes and its composites using wet-chemical precipitation method for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). To enhance the optical and electrical properties of TiO2 and to reduce the electron-hole recombination, tuning of band gap was done by preparing photoanode based on copper oxide (CuO) and nickel oxide (NiO)–TiO2 nanocomposite. The structural, morphological, and bond formation characterization of nanocomposites formed were carried out using XRD, SEM, and FTIR. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy, both the nanocomposites were found to have smaller band gaps and greater particle sizes than TiO2. Moreover, the reduction of the band gap and PL quenching in nanocomposites imply the formation of modified type-II structure facilitating charge transportation and reduce the recombination rates.

The phase purity and lattice parameters were determined by Rietveld refinements, which were conducted by using the GSAS program with the EXPGUI interface [51, 52]. Morphologies, particle sizes, and microstructures of synthesized samples were recorded by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, FEI), and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) mapping. The specific surface areas of the samples were determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption device (ASAP 2460).\n2.3 Half-cell measurement\nThe electrochemical performance of AlxFe1-xNb11O29/Li (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2) was evaluated by employing CR2016-type coin cells. Firstly, the working electrodes were prepared by mixing 70 wt% of AlxFe1-xNb11O29 (active material) powder, 20 wt% of conductive carbon (Super P, battery level), and 10 wt% of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, thoroughly mixed in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry. After stirring the slurry for 8 h, the slurry was coated onto a copper foil evenly. The mass loading of AlxFe1-xNb11O29 was ~ 1.0 mg cm−2. Then, the coated foils were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 10 h and were cut into a circular plate with a diameter of 10 mm. The CR2016 coin cells were assembled in a glove box filled with argon gas (O2/H2O < 0.1 ppm) and consisted of an above as-prepared electrode, a Li foil that acted as counter and reference electrodes, a microporous polypropylene film (Celgard 2325) and electrolyte containing 1 M LiPF6 (DAN VEC) in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and diethylene carbonate (DEC) with a volume ratio of 1:1:1. Galvanostatic discharge–charge measurements and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests were performed on a Neware battery tester. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. The electrochemical performance was examined within 3.0–0.8 V. To prepare the AlxFe1-xNb11O29 electrodes for ex situ XRD, the half cells at different states of discharge/charge were disassembled in the glove box, followed by washing the obtained AlxFe1-xNb11O29 electrodes by dimethyl carbonate.\n2.4 Full-cell measurement\nFull cells (CR2032-type coin cells) were assembled with the as-prepared Al0.2Fe0.8Nb11O29 as the anode and commercial LiFePO4 as the cathode. Similarly, LiFePO4 powder, conductive carbon (Super P), and PVDF with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 were thoroughly mixed in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry. Then, the slurry was spread evenly on an Al foil and made into a circular plate with a diameter of 10 mm. The LiFePO4:Al0.2Fe0.8Nb11O29 weight ratio was fixed to be 2:1. Galvanostatic discharge–charge measurements were performed within 1.0–2.5 V.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "AlxFe1-xNb11O29", "Syns_method": "solid-state reaction", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Nb2O5", "amount": "calculated amount"}, "prc2": {"name": "Fe2O3", "amount": "calculated amount"}, "prc3": {"name": "Al2O3", "amount": "calculated amount"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ball-milling", "parameters": {"time": "4 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "sinter", "parameters": {"temperature": "1300 °C", "time": "4 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "FeNb11O29", "Syns_method": "solid-state reaction", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Nb2O5", "amount": "calculated amount"}, "prc2": {"name": "Fe2O3", "amount": "calculated amount"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "ball-milling", "parameters": {"time": "4 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "sinter", "parameters": {"temperature": "1300 °C", "time": "4 h"}}}}}}}

Glacial acetic acid (AR, 99 %), N, N-dimethylformamide (98 %, DMF), tetrahydrofuran (AR, 99 %, THF), and ethanol (AR) were purchased from Sinophurt Chemical Reagent Co., LTD. (China). Chitosan was provided by Nanjing Wanqing Chemical Glass Instrument Co., LTD., China. All other reagents were of analytical grade without any treatment. In addition, all the solutions in this experiment were prepared with deionized water. 2.1.1 Preparation of covalent organic framework COF-LZU1 was prepared as reported in the previous work with improved parameters [24]. As shown in Fig. 1 , 50 mg PDA and 50 mg TFB were ultrasonically dissolved in 5 mL 1,4-dioxane. 1 mL of aqueous acetic acid (3 mol L−1) was added to the suspension as a catalyst, and the yellow solid precipitates were obtained after continuous stirring at room temperature for 5 h. The yellow solid was collected by filtration and washed a few times using DMF and THF to remove the remaining precursor. Finally, the COF powders were obtained after rapidly frozen in a liquid nitrogen bath and vacuum freeze-drying. 2.1.2 Preparation of COF/CS aerogel COF/CS aerogel was prepared by sol-gel process (Fig. 1). Firstly, COF powders were added to 20 mL acetic acid solution (2 %) at room temperature under ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Secondly, CS powder was added to the above solution and stirred until CS was completely dissolved. A transparent solution with homogeneous dispersion of COF was obtained. Then, 0.2 mL of 5 % glutaraldehyde was dripped as a crosslinker and stirred continuously for 2 h. Finally, the COF/CS aerogel was obtained using vacuum freeze-drying. The COF/CS aerogel with COF mass percentages of 20 wt%, 30 wt%, 40 wt%, 50 wt%, and 60 wt% was prepared according to different COF powder content. For the comparison, pure CS aerogel was also prepared by vacuum freeze-drying. The difference with the preparation of COF/CS aerogel is that COF powder is not added, and the rest of the steps are the same. 2.2 Characterization Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-78OOF, Japan) to CS aerogel, COF powder, and COF/CS aerogel morphology have been characterized. To ensure clearer images, the material was sprayed with a thin coating of gold ions to improve conductivity. XRD patterns of COF powder, CS aerogel, and COF-CS-30 wt% aerogel were collected by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Smart Lab 3KW, Japan). The pore size and specific surface area of the materials were measured with a BET analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP2020M analyzer, USA) to obtain N2 adsorption-desorption curves. The thermal stability of the material was obtained by TGA-Shimadzu-50 (ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 and temperature range of 25 to 800 °C). FT-IR in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 was obtained by using FT-IR-Shimadzu −8400 S. 2.3 Adsorption experiments 2.3.1 Adsorption of iodine in liquids Since radioactive iodine is dangerous, the non-radioactive natural isotope 127I, which has almost the same physicochemical properties, was chosen for the study. Firstly, 1 g I2 and 2.69 g KI were dissolved in 1 L deionized water to get 1000 mg L−1 of an iodine solution. Iodine solutions of 250 to 500 mg L−1 were prepared from stock solutions. The effects of adsorbent dose, temperature, initial iodine solution concentration, and contact time on adsorption were investigated by batch adsorption experiments. To examine the effect of the initial concentration of iodine solution experiment, 10 mg aerogel was placed into 50 mL iodine solution at 250 to 500 mg L−1, and the concentration of iodine solution was determined after the adsorption reached equilibrium. To investigate the influence of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption performance, aerogels of different masses (5–25 mg) were added into 50 mL, 400 mg L−1 iodine solution. Adsorption kinetics experiments were performed by adding 10 mg of aerogel to 400 mg L−1 of 50 mL of iodine solution. The solution's residual concentration was measured at set time intervals to observe the change in adsorption with time. The adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted at 318 K, 308 K, and 298 K. A 10 mg aerogel was added to a 50 mL iodine solution at a concentration of 250 to 500 mg L−1. The iodine solution has a UV characteristic peak at 287.5 nm. Therefore, residue concentrations were determined with a UV–vis spectrophotometer (TU-1810, Beijing General Instrument Co., LTD.). The adsorption capacity is calculated by the following equation [35]. (1) q t = C O − C t m × V (2) q e = C O − C e m × V where V is the volume of the solution (mL), q e and q t are the adsorption capacity (mg g−1) at the time of adsorption equilibrium, and the moment of t (min). C t , C e , and C 0 are the concentrations (mg L−1) of the iodine solution at the moment t, at equilibrium and initially, respectively. And m is the mass of adsorbent (mg). 2.3.2 Adsorption of iodine vapor A large amount of radioactive iodine vapor is produced during the nuclear fuel cycle, posing a significant safety hazard to the ecosystem and human beings [36]. Therefore, capturing I2 vapor is significant for the sustainable development and safety of nuclear energy. For direct comparison with the previously developed adsorbents, the same experimental setup was used to investigate the capture ability for volatile I2 by gravimetry [37]. As the experimental setup shown in Fig. S1, three small 50 mL beakers were sealed in a large 2000 mL beaker and put into the oven at a temperature of 348 k. The iodine monomers and the COF/CS aerogel were added to the small beaker, respectively. The third small beaker was used as a reference. After a period of contact time, take the large beaker out of the oven. The small beaker containing the aerogel and the reference beaker are weighed to calculate the adsorption capacity. Next, the large beaker was placed into the oven and continued to adsorb until adsorption equilibrium. The absorption capacity (q t ) of I2 vapor is calculated by the following formula: (3) q t = m t − m 1 − M t − M 0 m 1 − m 0 where m t (g) represents the weight of the beaker containing the adsorbent at the moment of t, M 0 (g) represents the weight of the reference beaker before adsorption, M t (g) represents the weight of the reference beaker at the moment of t, m 1 (g) represents the weight of the beaker containing the adsorbent before adsorption, and m 0 (g) represents the weight of the empty beaker containing the adsorbent.", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "COF-LZU1", "Syns_method": "solution synthesis", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "p-phenylenediamine", "amount": "50 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxaldehyde", "amount": "50 mg"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C4H8O2", "amount": "5 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "filtration"}, "post_proc2": {"step": "wash", "parameters": {"solvent": "DMF and THF"}}, "post_proc3": {"step": "freeze-dry"}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "COF/CS aerogel", "Syns_method": "sol-gel", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "COF-LZU1"}, "prc2": {"name": "glutaraldehyde", "amount": "0.2 mL of 5% solution"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "CH3COOH", "amount": "20 mL (2%)"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "freeze-dry"}}}}}}

The organic linker H2PZDC·H2O (371 mg) was first dissolved in DMF (8 mL) in a glass reactor. Next, HCOOH (7 mL) was added to the above mixture. Afterwards, an aqueous solution of Zr(NO3)4·5H2O (0.533 mol/L, 4 mL) was added dropwise to the above synthetic system, and the obtained mixture was placed in a round-bottomed flask and heated and stirred at 100 °C for 15 min. The solution was cooled to room temperature, then centrifuged to remove the mother liquor, and the acquired solid was dispersed in DMF (20 mL) and acetone (20 mL) and centrifuged twice, then dried in an oven at 70 °C for 6 h to obtain the target DUT-67-PZDC. 2.2 Synthesis of Pd/DUT-67-PZDC catalysts and related comparative samples The series of the Pd/DUT-67-PZDC catalysts were addressed by a facile co-reduction method. Specifically, for the optimal catalyst Pd/DUT-67-PZDC(10) as an example, Na2PdCl4 (15.00 mg, 0.05 mmol) was mixed with 48.9 mg of DUT-67-PZDC in DI water (5 mL), followed by a sonication for 30 min and stirring for 6 h. Following this, excess NaBH4 (37.8 mg, 1 mmol) was added to the aforementioned mixture, which was then stirred for an additional 30 min. The obtained mixture was centrifuged (10000 rpm, 5 min) and washed three times with excess DI water (25 mL per time). Finally, in a vacuum oven, the resulting gray-black sample was dried at 60 °C overnight to gain the optimized catalyst Pd/DUT-67-PZDC(10). Additionally, to emamine the impact of varying Pd loading about catalytic activity, series of the Pd/DUT-67-PZDC catalysts were successfully synthesized with varying Pd loadings (5 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%) using an analogous method that applied for the Pd/DUT-67-PZDC with 10 wt% Pd loading, only by changing the quantity of the DUT-67-PZDC support used in the related synthetic process, and these prepared catalysts could be named as Pd/DUT-67-PZDC(5), Pd/DUT-67-PZDC(15), Pd/DUT-67-PZDC(20), respectively. Likewise, to study the functionalities of the dual N sites on the MOF supports over the catalytic performances, the comparative Pd/DUT-67-PZDC-CH3 catalyst was synthesized according to the same procedure as Pd/DUT-67-PZDC(10) catalyst except changing the catalyst support from DUT-67-PZDC to DUT-67-PZDC-CH3. In addition, the comparative Pd/C catalyst was synthesized according to the same procedure as Pd/DUT-67-PZDC(10) catalyst except changing the catalyst support from DUT-67-PZDC to C. 2.3 Materials characterizations The catalysts and related samples were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms.

A series of TiO2/RGO nanocomposites were then prepared by adding different reducing agents, namely, ascorbic acid, l-cysteine, hydrazine monohydrate and sodium borohydride, after the addition of titanium(iv) butoxide. The hydrothermal reaction was then continued using the above-described procedure. The synthesised TiO2/RGO nanocomposites were denoted as TiO2/RGO/AA, TiO2/RGO/CS, TiO2/RGO/HH and TiO2/RGO/SB, respectively, based on the reducing agent used in the hydrothermal reaction. The mechanism of the synthesis can be explained as follows. First, the titanium(iv) butoxide is easily converted to Ti(OH)2 and is anchored on the surface of the GO. During the hydrothermal reaction, Ti(OH)2 is formed and oxidised to TiO2, while the GO is reduced to RGO, and the TiO2/RGO nanocomposites are obtained.\nThe TiO2/RGO/CPE was prepared by hand-mixing a 70 : 30 ratio of graphite powder and silicone oil and the optimized amount of the TiO2/RGO nanocomposites that were synthesized by the hydrothermal method using the different reducing agents. The obtained homogeneous paste was packed into the cavity of the working electrode. The surface renewal was carried out by replacing the surface layer with bulk modification and polishing the electrode surface with smooth paper. The unmodified CPE was prepared using the same procedure described above without adding the TiO2/RGO nanocomposite. The details of the construction of the electrode surface are the same as those given in our previous papers.64–67\n", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "TiO2/RGO/HT", "Syns_method": "hydrothermal", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "GO", "amount": "0.2 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ti(OBu)4", "amount": "1 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "80 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent1": {"reagent": "Na2CO3", "ph": "8.0"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "160 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "TiO2/RGO/AA", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "GO", "amount": "0.2 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ti(OBu)4", "amount": "1 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "80 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent1": {"reagent": "Na2CO3", "ph": "8.0"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "160 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "TiO2/RGO/CS", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "GO", "amount": "0.2 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ti(OBu)4", "amount": "1 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "80 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent1": {"reagent": "Na2CO3", "ph": "8.0"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "160 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}, "MAT4": {"name": "TiO2/RGO/HH", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "GO", "amount": "0.2 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ti(OBu)4", "amount": "1 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "80 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent1": {"reagent": "Na2CO3", "ph": "8.0"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "160 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}, "MAT5": {"name": "TiO2/RGO/SB", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "GO", "amount": "0.2 g"}, "prc2": {"name": "Ti(OBu)4", "amount": "1 mL"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "H2O", "amount": "80 mL"}}, "ph_adjuster": {"reagent1": {"reagent": "Na2CO3", "ph": "8.0"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "hydrothermal", "parameters": {"temperature": "160 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "24 h"}}}}}}}

However, rapid development in various manufacturing industries has caused exceptional usage of hydrocarbon fuels. As a result, many burning issues such as rapidly depleting hydrocarbon sources, increased energy prices and rapidly warming atmosphere have been developed. Photocatalysis is a green process and can be used to generate high energy modules from water, and carbon dioxide. The process is extremely beneficial to reduce the impacts of CO2 by converting it into energy rich modules. Many different semiconductors have been used to realize energy crises, environmental issues, and organic synthesis. However, insufficient solar light absorption and poor charge separation are mainly encountered in the way of efficient photocatalysis. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are the recently introduced modules in many fields to address energy production and environmental issues. Owing to their special characteristics of porous nature, huge flexibility in structural morphology and high surface area, both MOFs and COFs are frequently used to assist native semiconductor materials in terms of light absorption, charge separation and redox species adsorption. They are believed to accelerate sluggish redox kinetics significantly. In this review article, we have discussed the role of MOFs and COFs in solar light driven photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis and electrocatalysis for energy production and organic synthesis.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "5 Experimental results Fig. 23 shows the prototype of the electric vehicle lithium battery charging systems. The battery charging systems included an AC source for the input, an interleaved PFC converter, an FBPS converter, and lithium batteries, where the MCUs (TMS320F28035, Texas Instruments) were used to control the interleaved PFC converter and apply digital compensation control to the FBPS converter. Further, a single-phase AC 220 V/60 Hz power was connected to an interleaved PFC. The interleaved PFC was connected with the FBPS converter in series, and the FBPS converter provided the charging function to the lithium battery of the electric vehicles. In this study, the proposed control strategy was compared with the traditional method. The traditional method consists of an FBPS converter and a boost PFC converter. The FBPS converter was operated by the resonant phase-shift control method, and the performance of the proposed control strategy was verified by actual measurement. Fig. 24 shows the actual measurement of the interleaved PFC converter. In particular, Fig. 24(a) shows the V universal and I universal waveforms of the interleaved PFC when V universal = 220 VAC, at a load power of 500 W. On the other hand, Fig. 24 (b) shows the V universal and I universal waveforms of the interleaved PFC when V universal = 220 VAC and load power of 1 kW. Fig. 25 shows the I in , I L1, and I L2 waveforms of the interleaved PFC when V universal = 220 VAC and load power is 1 kW. Its actual measurement results can prove the proposed interleaved control's capability to operate stably and improve the pf approximately to 1.0 [as Fig. 24 (a) and (b)]. Fig. 26 shows the measured V GS2 , V GS4 , V DS2 , and V DS4 waveforms of the FBPS converter in constant voltage (CV) charging mode (V o = 60 V). With the proposed TPTZ control strategy, V GS2 and V DS2 have ZVS (represented by the orange oval). Similarly, V GS4 and V DS4 have ZVS (represented by the red oval). Therefore, the proposed TPTZ control method can greatly improve the performance of the system. Fig. 27 presents the measured V GS2 , V GS4, and Vp waveforms of the FBPS converter charging a battery system (48 V) with a constant current I o = 10 A. Through the proposed TPTZ control strategy, Q2 and Q4 have ZVS, which improves system performance (Fig. 26) and transfers the Vp power to the current doubler circuit on the transformer's secondary side to provide power for charging the battery system. The oscillation situation of Vp resulted from the implementation of the ZVS operation (V GS and V DS ) by the leakage inductance of the transformer, resonant inductor L r , and parasitic capacitances of the power MOSFETs. Fig. 28 shows the measured V GS2 , V GS4 , and Vp waveforms of the FBPS converter charging a battery system (60 V) with a constant current I o = 10 A. Similarly, Q2 and Q4 have ZVS, which improves system performance (Fig. 26) and transfers the Vp power to the current doubler circuit on the transformer's secondary side to provide power for charging the battery system. The oscillation situation of Vp is attributed to the ZVS operation (V GS and V DS ) implemented by the leakage inductance of the transformer, resonant inductor L r , and parasitic capacitances of the power MOSFETs in this study. Fig. 29 shows the I o waveforms of the PSFB converter (V o = 60 V) after the output load changes. The initial current of I o was 9 A. However, the load demand suddenly increased (I o increased to 16 A; indicated by the red oval), and the load demand decreased accordingly (I o dropped to 9 A; indicated by the orange oval). As shown in Fig. 29, the FBPS converter can control V o and I o stably and rapidly, where the response time (time ≅ 10 ms) is better than the traditional PI control, hybrid fuzzy SMC, and MPC method [42]. The battery system can have a high-quality power supply for charging under safe operating conditions. The comparisons between the proposed battery charging system architecture with the proposed TPTZ control method and the traditional architecture with the common control method are shown in Table 4 . All efficiencies η are calculated by Formula (54) as follows: (54) η = V o ⋅ I o V universal ⋅ I universal The proposed TPTZ method performs better than the traditional control method at loads (25 %, 50 %, and 100 %), with high efficiencies of 96 % and 95 % operating in CV and CC charging mode, respectively. Therefore, this study verified that the proposed battery charging system with the proposed TPTZ control strategy is far superior to the traditional architecture with the common control methods. Finally, Figs. 20, 29, and Table 4 demonstrate the high charging performance of the FBPS converter combined with the TPTZ digital compensation control method and the proposed battery charging control strategy. Not only that the FBPS has a fast response and high system conversion efficiency operating in CV and CC charging modes, but it also switches CV and CC charging modes flexibly according to the battery SOC/depth of discharge (DoD).", "output": {}}

The transesterification reaction was performed using WCO collected from canteen kitchen.\nSynthesis of magnesium oxide nanocatalyst by sol-gel method\nThe methodology for synthesis of MgO is reported elsewhere [26]. Magnesium acetate tetrahydrate (1.65 M) of mass 53.2075 g was dissolved in 150 ml of absolute ethanol under constant stirring in a magnetic stirrer for 2 h. The stirring was continued until the particles were completely dissolved and form a milky white solution. A total of 1 M oxalic acid dihydrate was added dropwise into the milky white solution until the pH drops to 5. This mixture was continuously stirred for few hours until it thickens into a white gel. The obtained gel was left overnight for further gelation and dried in an oven at 100 °C for 15 h. The dried sample was ground using mortar and pestle to produce a fine powder. Calcinating this powder at high temperature (600 °C, 2 h) results in the formation of MgO nanostructures.\nSynthesis of tin oxide nanoparticles by thermal decomposition method\nA total of 1.15 g of tin (II) chloride dihydrate was weighed in a silica crucible and then heated in a muffle furnace at decomposition temperature of 600 °C for a reaction time of 20 min, and gray color fine powder is obtained upon completion of the reaction.\nSynthesis of MgO-SnO2 nanocomposites\nSnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by thermal decomposition of tin (II) chloride dihydrate (4 g) at 600 °C for 20 min. Magnesium acetate tetrahydrate (53.2075 g) was initially dissolved in 100 ml of ethanol under constant stirring using a magnetic stirrer. The ratio of MgO to SnO2 was kept at 15:1; SnO2 (0.4 g) synthesized by thermal decomposition is dispersed in 50 ml of absolute ethanol. The SnO2 solution was added dropwise to the earlier mixture of magnesium acetate and ethanol. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5 using 1 M oxalic acid dihydrate (C2H4O2.2H2O). The mixture was continuously stirred until a thick gel was formed. The gel formed was left overnight for further gelation process before being dried in an oven at 100 °C for 15 h. The dried materials were ground using mortar and pestle to produce fine powder. Subsequently, these particles were calcinated at 600 °C for 2 h to form MgO-SnO2 nanocomposites.\nCharacterization of MgO-SnO2 nanocomposites\nThe powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum for the synthesized samples was documented on a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer using Cu–Kα radiation (λ = 0.154065 nm). JCPDS (Joint Committee of the Powder Diffraction Standard) database files were used to identify the phases present in the sample. The nanocomposite structure formation was studied using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (FEI Company of the USA, model: Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin (FEG-based TEM)). The particle size was measured using the quantitative tools in the ImageJ software. Elemental composition and phase of these nanoparticles were confirmed using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Optical absorption studies were performed using UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 60), and band gap energy of the nanocomposites was recorded. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was studied for the nanocomposites in the region of 400–4000 cm−1 using a FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet, model number: 6700) with KBR pellet method. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis was carried out using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 with degassing conditions of 150 °C and 100 mm Hg for 180 min and degassing ramp rate of 10 °C/min and 50 mmHg/s with a vacuum set point of 500 μm Hg with evacuation time of 60 min. The surface composition of the synthesized nanocomposite was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (K-Alpha-KAN9954133, Thermo Scientific).\nTransesterification of waste cooking oil\nThe transesterification of WCO was carried out in a closed beaker in a hot plate setup with a magnetic stirrer. Basic sites of MgO-SnO2 were found out to be 2 mmol/g using back titration method [27, 28]. Required amount of MgO-SnO2 nanocatalyst was added to the beaker and then stirred along with methanol for a duration of 30 min. The desired quantity of pretreated WCO was added to the beaker, and transesterification was carried out at required reaction temperature along with the premixed solution consisting of methanol and nanocatalyst. The reaction mixture was filtered using a Whatman filter paper and centrifuged to separate the catalyst at the end of the reaction. The mixture was poured into a separating funnel and allowed to stand for 24 h to separate the biodiesel in the upper layer and glycerol in the bottom layer. Obtained biodiesel was heated at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h to remove the moisture and unreacted methanol. Transesterification reaction conditions were optimized by changing the parameters such as methanol to oil molar ratio (9:1 to 21:1), catalyst concentration (1–4 wt%), reaction duration (30–180 min), and reaction temperature (40–80 °C), respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) was used to detect the conversion of biodiesel and the presence of monoglycerides, diglycerides, and unreacted triglycerides. The yield of biodiesel from the waste cooking oil was found out using the Eq. 2 given by the following:\nY\ni\ne\nl\nd\n \no\nf\n \nb\ni\no\nd\ni\ne\ns\ne\nl\n=\n(\nw\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\n \no\nf\n \nf\na\nt\nt\ny\n \na\nc\ni\nd\n \nm\ne\nt\nh\ny\nl\n \ne\ns\nt\ne\nr\ns\n/\nw\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\n \no\nf\n \no\ni\nl\n)\n×\n100\n (2) \nCharacterization of waste cooking oil and biodiesel\nWCO was filtered with a fine cloth to remove all the insoluble impurities and then heated at 110 °C to remove the moisture. The pretreated WCO was stored in an airtight container for further use. The acid value, density, and average molecular weight of the waste cooking oil were found out to be 3.52 mg KOH g−1, 0.92 g/ml, and 870 g/mol. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography along with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to confirm the conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was carried out in Agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 m HP-5 MS column of internal diameter 0.25 mm and 0.15 μm film thickness. Sample was introduced in split injection with a split ratio of 50:1. The oven temperature was started at 25 °C and then ramped at 50 °C per min to 230 °C withhold time of 3 and 5 min, respectively. Helium gas was introduced at the rate of 1 μl/min in a constant mode. The fatty acid composition of the waste cooking oil obtained from GC-MS spectra is palmitic acid (9.47%) and stearic acid (6.76%) which are considered to be saturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (56.27%) which is a polyunsaturated fatty acid, and oleic acid (27.51%) which is a monounsaturated fatty acid.

In this work, we have synthesized and analyzed the mechanical properties of novel HKUST-1 shaped composites based on methylcellulose (MC) and poly(vinyl formal) (PVMF), using a simple and inexpensive extrusion technique. The composites were characterized using different techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis, which demonstrated that their structure and crystallinity were not compromised by the shaping process. Their mechanical properties were investigated by compressive strength measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The composite with methyl cellulose showed good mechanical resistance, with an average crushing strength value of 40 N. Nitrogen sorption measurements showed that the specific surface area reduction due to the shaping process for HKUST@MC was only 8.6%. The greater hydrolytic stability after heat activation of HKUST@MC compared to that of the pure MOF was also verified. The adsorptive capacity of HKUST@MC towards organosulfur compounds found in sour gas was evaluated in a desulfurization test using a realistic multicomponent gas mixture. HKUST@MC exhibiting a high efficiency to adsorb organosulfur outperformed the benchmark sulfur adsorbent Norit RGM 3 in the adsorption of ethanethiol and dimethyl disulfide.

Liquid cooling can be a promising thermal management strategy for high energy density batteries due to its high heat transfer coefficient. However, conventional liquid cooling modules for large-scale battery packages require a high pumping power due to a long and serpentine flow path. They also induce a high-temperature deviation of battery cells since the coolant temperature gradually increases from inlet to outlet. Here, we introduce an energy-efficient liquid cooling module incorporating manifold flow distributors connected to a porous metal layer. The thermohydraulic performances of BTMS are investigated using both numerical and experimental platforms for the battery package composed of 24 pouch-type cells. The total energy capacity and heat generation of the package are determined to be ∼6.9 kWh and 504 W, respectively. The cooling module is designed to minimize the vortex generation within the cooling path, maximizing heat exchange area, and minimizing heat spreading resistance. The developed liquid cooling module shows ∼12.9 % higher temperature uniformity and 7.4 % lower maximum cell temperature compared to the straight channel-based module utilizing the same flow rate. The proposed liquid cooling strategy provides ∼43.3 °C of the maximum cell temperature with below 2 °C of temperature deviation by consuming only 3 L/min, which is ∼4.2 times lower flow rate compared to that of previously reported straight channel-based BTMS.

Polyphenols can be purified to realize high-value deep processing of apple pomace and to promote energy reuse of food waste. In this study, the highly selective purification of polyphenols was achieved by membrane filtration using prepared Metal-organic framework (MOF)-5/PES mixed matrix membranes with apple peels as raw material. The polyethersulfone mixed matrix membrane was loaded with MOF-5 by the phase inversion method, and their structural and physicochemical properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Zeta potential and specific surface area of MOF-5 particles were measured, as well as the water contact angle and anti-fouling properties of the mixed matrix membrane were analyzed. It was confirmed that the membrane loaded with MOF-5 showed better hydrophilicity and mechanical properties compared with the pristine polyether sulfone membrane. Under practical conditions, the increased hydrophilicity could enhance the anti-fouling properties of membranes, which would improve the flux recovery ratio of membranes. In addition, the prepared MOF-5/PES mixed matrix membrane was applied to the purification of polyphenols, showing excellent purification performance of polyphenols. In particular, the purity of polyphenol after membrane filtration could reach 70.45% when the additional amount of MOF-5 was 10%.

{"instruction": "Extract the following experimental section text:", "input": "Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O), hexanedioic (HOOC–(CH2)4–COOH), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), and methanol were purchased from Adamas-Beta. Lithium nitrate (LiNO3), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and sulfur powder were obtained from Aladdin. 1,3-Dioxolane (DOL), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), and lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade and used as received without further purification.\nFirstly, Mg-MOF was synthesized via the solvothermal method. For the synthesis of Mg-MOF, 530 mg of hexanedioic was dissolved in 40 mL of DMA (denoted as A), and 840 mg of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 20 mL of methanol (denoted as B). Solution A and B were mixed and stirred for 10 min at room temperature, and then transferred to a solvothermal reactor for 24 h at 120 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the product was washed briefly with methanol and filtered to collect the Mg-MOF powder, which was then transferred to a vacuum oven and heated at 80 °C for 6 h. To synthesize MgOx–C, the Mg-MOF powder was transferred to a tubular furnace, and annealed at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 up to 350 °C for 12 h under an inert atmosphere, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. MgO–C was obtained by oxygen supplement after annealing MgOx–C in air for 6 h at 350 °C. Finally, the resultant MgOx–C (or MgO–C) powder and PVDF binder were mixed in a mass ratio of 9 : 1 in NMP solvent, and then coated evenly on Cu foil. The thickness of the MgOx–C coating was adjusted by controlling its loading on the Cu foil. The general coating loading was ∼1.1 mg cm−2. After drying at 50 °C in a vacuum oven overnight, the modified Cu current collector was cut into discs with a diameter of 12 mm for use in the cell assembly.\nThe LiFePO4 cathode was commercially obtained from Hefei Kejing Materials Technology Co., Ltd. The mass loading of LiFePO4 was ∼10 mg cm−2. The sulfur cathode was prepared according to our previous work (DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.9b04519). Specifically, a mixture of nitrogen-doped carbon (derived from adenine) and sulfur in a ratio of 1 : 3 was placed in a quartz glass tube and then heated at a rate of 1 °C min−1 to 160 °C for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain S@NCs. Then, the sulfur cathode was prepared by mixing S@NCs, Super P, and PVDF in a ratio of 7 : 2 : 1 in NMP solvent, and then coated on carbon paper with a scalpel. The sulfur loading was ∼1.5 mg cm−2.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a FEI Magellan 400 equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher, England) with an Al-Kα source (1486.6 eV). The Li/Cu asymmetric cells were disassembled in an argon-filled glove box to observe the morphology and analyze the composition of the cycled electrodes via SEM and XPS, respectively. After washing several times with DME, the cycled electrode was placed in a sealed container filled with argon for SEM and XPS test. An Ar+ ion beam was used to etch the SEI layer of the Li@MgOx–C and Li@Cu electrodes to obtain deeper chemical composition information. By controlling the etching time, the etching thickness was estimated to be about 1.6 to 2 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a powder X-ray diffractometer (D8, Bruker) using Cu-Kα radiation at room temperature. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (77 K) were measured using a Quadrasorb SI gas sorption analyzer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Nicolet 7800 spectrometer with KBr discs. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed on an Electro-Spin Resonance Spectrometer (100G-18KG/EMX-8/2.7, Bruker Optics, Inc.). Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Laser Micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw plc) with an He–Ne laser at 514 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) were performed in ambient air with a Brucker Dimension Icon atomic force microscope equipped with an EFM module. The samples were first dispersed by ultrasonication in ethanol and then transferred to an SiO2/Si substrate for testing.\nCR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with Li foil as the counter electrode, and the electrolyte was a solution of 1 M LiTFSI in DOL/DME (1 : 1, v/v) with 2 wt% LiNO3. For the Li/Cu asymmetrical cells, Cu foil coated by MgOx–C (or pristine Cu foil) served as the working electrode, and the separator was glass fiber. A fixed capacity of Li was firstly plated on the working electrode at various current densities, and this process was then followed by stripping up to 0.5 V (vs. Li+/Li) on a LAND-CT2001A battery system to evaluate the Li plating behavior and coulombic efficiency (CE) evolution. For the Li/Li symmetrical cells, Li with a capacity of 5 mA h cm−2 was firstly pre-deposited on Cu foil coated by MgOx–C (or pristine Cu foil) in the architecture of the asymmetrical cell, and then the cells were disassembled to obtain the Li@MgOx–C anode for the use in the symmetrical cell assembly. The separator was also glass fiber. A fixed capacity of Li was applied to the electrodes under various current densities during repeated stripping/plating, while the potential was recorded with time to evaluate the cycling stability and voltage hysteresis. The full cells were based on LiFePO4 (or S@NCs) as the cathode and Li@MgOx–C as the anode. For the LiFePO4 full cells, the separator was glass fiber and the voltage range was from 2.0 to 3.8 V. In the case of the Li–S full cells, the separator was Celgard 3501, and the voltage range was from 1.8 to 2.7 V. The amount of electrolyte for the Li–LiFePO4 and Li–S full cells was about 120 and 20 μL respectively. The electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio was about 15 μL mg−1.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed on a Solartron frequency analyzer (1260-1296) with a frequency in the range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and potential impulse in the symmetrical cells were performed on a PARSTAT electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research, USA). The scan rate and voltage range of LSV were 1 mV s−1 and −0.2 to 0.2 V, respectively. The potential impulse technique was performed with a 5 mV voltage bias to obtain the initial and steady-state currents at the potentiostatic mode.\nThe potential impulse technique and AC impedance were employed for the calculation of the Li+ transference number (tLi+) in the symmetrical cell. The value of tLi+ was calculated according to the equation: where ΔV represents the voltage bias, I0 and Is are the initial and steady-state currents, and R0 and Rs are the electrochemical resistance of the cell before and after the operation of the potential impulse technique, respectively.\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculation for MgO and MgOx was performed with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code, in which a plane wave basis set was chosen for expansion of the valence-electron wave functions at the local density approximation (LDA) level. Two steps were carried out for calculating the band structures of MgO and MgOx. The first step was to optimize the crystal structure using the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shannon (BFGS) method. The second step was to calculate the band structure and density of states (DOS). The lattice parameters and atom coordinates were fixed at the values obtained by the crystal structure optimization process in the first step. For both steps, the kinetic energy cutoff was set as 400 eV. The criterion for the self-consistent field (SCF) was eigenenergy convergence within 1.0 × 10−6 eV per atom.\nFirst-principles computations based on DFT using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) were employed to evaluate the absorption energies of the TFSI− ions on the (200) planes of MgO and MgO with oxygen defects (i.e. MgOx). The projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials as implemented in VASP and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange–correlation functional were employed. We performed all the computations in a 3 × 3 × 2 MgO (or MgOx) supercell with an energy cutoff of 500 eV. The vacuum thickness was set to 15 Å along the z-axis. Therefore, a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling scheme was chosen for Brillouin zone integration. The structures were relaxed with an energy convergence criterion of 10−5 eV until the remaining force on each atom was less than 0.05 eV Å−1.\nThe absorption energy Ea is defined as:Ea = EMgO (or MgOx) + TFSI− − (EMgO (or MgOx) + ETFSI−) where EMgO (or MgOx) + TFSI− is the total energy of MgO (or MgOx) with a TFSI− ion attached, and EMgO (or MgOx) and ETFSI− are the energies of MgO (or MgOx) and of one TFSI− ion, respectively.\n", "output": {"MAT1": {"name": "Mg-MOF", "Syns_method": "solvothermal method", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "C6H10O4", "amount": "530 mg"}, "prc2": {"name": "Mg(NO3)2·6H2O", "amount": "840 mg"}}, "solvents": {"sov1": {"name": "C5H10NO", "amount": "40 mL"}, "sov2": {"name": "CH3OH", "amount": "20 mL"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "heat", "parameters": {"temperature": "120 °C", "time": "24 h"}}, "post_proc2": {"step": "dry", "parameters": {"temperature": "80 °C", "time": "6 h"}}}}}, "MAT2": {"name": "MgOx–C", "Syns_method": "annealing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "Mg-MOF"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "350 °C", "time": "12 h", "atmosphere": "inert"}}}}}, "MAT3": {"name": "MgO–C", "Syns_method": "annealing", "Syns_processing": {"precursors": {"prc1": {"name": "MgOx–C"}}, "post_processing": {"post_proc1": {"step": "anneal", "parameters": {"temperature": "350 °C", "time": "6 h", "atmosphere": "air"}}}}}}}

The stability improvement of the prepared micro-nano scale composite due to the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles preserves the superhydrophobic feature created by the hierarchical structure and the fatty acid placed on the surface.

However, the irreversible release of lattice oxygen will cause LLO surface reconstruction and electrolyte decomposition, resulting in low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), high interface resistance as well as severe voltage and capacity degradation. Herein, a facile and effective strategy is proposed to stabilize the cathode materials by coating the LLO with spinel MgAl2O4. It is found that the robust MgAl2O4 (MAO) decoration layer can not only alleviate the lattice mismatch to sustain the structure integrity, but also inhibit the side reactions with electrolyte during long-term cycles. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show that the surface oxygen release energy barrier is increased with the surface decoration of MAO. Accordingly, the coated LLO-based hetero-structured cathode exhibits a higher ICE (80.14%) and lower interface resistance than that of LLO electrode.

X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) has reformed conventional PDT for deep-seated tumors by using penetrating X-rays, but its application faces the challenge of efficiently integrating scintillators with photosensitizers. In this study, core–shell nanocomposites rationally integrating NaGdF4:Tb@NaGdF4:Ce@NaLuF4 nanoparticles with Hf-porphyrin metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) using a surface-assisted epitaxial growth strategy have been proposed and synthesized. Herein, NaGdF4:Tb@NaGdF4:Ce@NaLuF4 nanoparticles demonstrate strong X-ray attenuation and bright green light emissions, serving as efficient scintillators to activate the photosensitizer. The porphyrin in MOFs can absorb and be further activated by the emission of a lanthanide-based scintillator, playing the role of a photosensitizer to generate a significant amount of singlet oxygen. Moreover, uniform nanocomposites with regular core–shell structures enable the maximization of energy transfer between the scintillator and MOFs, and the inherent pores of MOFs facilitate the diffusion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) out of the interior to boost PDT efficacy. In addition, the existence of heavy atoms such as Gd, Lu, and Hf can significantly enhance radiation sensitization, facilitating the production of hydroxyl radicals.
