            [input rule]
            1. Material Identification:
               - Assign "MAT1", "MAT2" labels for distinct materials
               - Format names as: Chemical formula
               - Preserve all original formula notations (e.g., MnOx, ZIF-67)

            2. Property Extraction:
               - Only the properties related to the material need to be extracted, other processes are not required.
               - If the description of the property field does not exist, then return empty dictionary.
               - All performance parameters must be stored in the props dictionary and no other fields are allowed to be added at the outer level.
               - Capture only numerical values with units (e.g. 203 mV, 854.45 A/g)
               - Include standardized metrics (e.g. overpotential, stability cycles)
               - Record comparative statements ("5x improvement", "exceeding 90%")
               - Theoretical calculations (e.g. d-band center optimization) are not considered as material properties.

            3. Contextual Requirements

               Q: Extract the following text: 'The primary challenges of BiVO4 include its poor stability and inefficient electron-hole pair separation. To enhance BiVO4 photoanode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a Co,Fe- nitrilotris (methylene phosphonic acid) (Co,Fe-NTMP) metal-organic co-catalyst was developed and applied to the BiVO4 photoelectrode surface using the SILAR technique. The proposed approach significantly improved charge separation and transfer. The optimized BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP photoanode exhibited a current density of 2.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, representing more than a fivefold increase compared to bare BiVO4 (0.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) under illumination of AM 1.5 G without a sacrificial agent. Additionally, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP reached 0.58 % at 0.83 V vs. RHE. The ∆OCP measurements indicated improved band bending and enhanced charge separation following the Co,Fe-NTMP coating. The BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP photoanode also demonstrated remarkable stability for 9000 s, which can attributed to the formation of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), which facilitates efficient electron transport. This mechanism was substantiated by XPS and DFT analyses.'

In this study, we present a novel luminescent sensor based on Metal-Organic Framework MOF-808 functionalized with Au25@BSA gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) for the highly sensitive detection of trace Hg²⁺ ions. MOF-808, known for its robust structure and versatile chemical environment, provides an ideal platform for incorporating gold nanoclusters that exhibit unique optical properties. The integration of Au25@BSA in MOF-808 framework enhances the temporal and thermal stability of the gold nanoclusters while preserving their photoluminescence properties. The MOF-808/Au25@BSA composite behaves as a sensor relying on the quenching effect of Hg²⁺ on the luminescence of the gold nanoclusters embedded within the MOF matrix, offering a highly selective and sensitive detection method at concentrations as low as nM levels. Comprehensive characterizations of the MOF-808/Au25@BSA composite were conducted. This sensor demonstrates remarkable performance with high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising tool for environmental monitoring and analysis.

               Q:Extract the following text: 'The development of efficient, cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing sustainable energy. In this study, we investigated the influence of the solvent type on the morphological evolution and electrocatalytic performance of cobalt-based ZIF-67 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Particularly, we demonstrated the significant effect of solvent-mediated morphological control on the OER performance using methanol (MeOH), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and deionized (DI) water. The ZIF-L(W), synthesized in DI water, exhibited a unique 2D leaf-like structure, and achieved remarkably low overpotentials of 360, 398, and 460 mV at current densities of 50, 100, and 200 mA cm−2, respectively. This performance significantly surpasses those of the polyhedral ZIF-67(D) and ZIF-67(M) structures synthesized in DMF and MeOH, respectively. The superior OER activity of ZIF-L(W) was attributed to its larger pore size, enhanced electron transfer properties, and the formation of unsaturated coordination sites. These results present a scalable, low-temperature route for designing high-performance MOF-based electrocatalysts with potential applications in sustainable energy systems.'

               Q:Extract the following text: 'The utilization of TiO2 for the fabrication of transparent photochromic materials is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly. However, it still poses challenges due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs and poor organic-inorganic compatibility. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in sustaining sacrificial electron donors for hole scavenging, demonstrating great potential in enhancing photochromic performance. Herein, Rb doping and lattice strain are applied to synergistically engineer oxygen vacancies, considering lattice oxygen release is influenced by charge neutrality and oxygen atom coordination environment. Furthermore, the particle surface is modified using composite siloxanes to ensure monodispersion and enhance organic-inorganic compatibility. Structural analyses and theoretical calculations indicate that Rb doping and epitaxial strain synergistically reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy and promote the chemical adsorption of diethylene glycol (DEG) on the TiO2 surface for hole scavenging. The designed DEG-added Rb-TiO2/TB-CS (TB means extra titanium butoxide, CS means composite siloxanes) nanodispersion exhibits a significant optical modulation amplitude exceeding 90% at 650 nm, rapid response within 60 s, and stable reversibility in color-switching (50 cycles). Moreover, utilizing Rb-TiO2/TB-CS with DEG ligands as a responsive material enables the fabrication of transparent photochromic polyacrylate-based hybrid films, polyvinyl alcohol-based hydrogels, and hydroxyethyl cellulose-based rewritable papers, showcasing its immense potential for diverse applications.'

               Q:Extract the following text: 'The deactivation of ozone decomposition catalysts has been a bottleneck in their industrial application. As an efficient catalyst regeneration method, the liquid-phase method has attracted wide attention due to its operability and universality. However, the amount of waste liquid generated by the used regeneration liquid is a major drawback of its application. Therefore, we propose an electrolytic regeneration method for cyclic regeneration of MnOx ozone decomposition catalysts by combining the advantages of the electrolytic process. In this method, NaNO2 solution is used to react with O22– to efficiently regenerate the inactivated MnOx catalysts, while NO2– is oxidized to NO3–, and then the oxidized NO3– can be efficiently reduced to NO2– through the electrolysis process at the cathode with an 88% Faraday efficiency, ultimately realizing the recycling of the NO2–/NO3– regeneration solution. By this method, the regeneration of inactivated MnOx ozone catalysts can be realized only using electricity.'

               Q:Extract the following text: 'The development of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production, which has always been restricted by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although IrOx is one of the benchmark acidic OER electrocatalysts, there are still challenges in designing highly active and stable Ir-based electrocatalysts for commercial application. Herein, a Ru-doped IrOx electrocatalyst with abundant twin boundaries (TB-Ru0.3Ir0.7Ox@ITO) is reported, employing indium tin oxide with high conductivity as the support material. Combing the TB-Ru0.3Ir0.7Ox nanoparticles with ITO support could expose more active sites and accelerate the electron transfer. The TB-Ru0.3Ir0.7Ox@ITO exhibits a low overpotential of 203 mV to achieve 10 mA cm–2 and a high mass activity of 854.45 A g–1noble metal at 1.53 V vs RHE toward acidic OER, which exceeds most reported Ir-based OER catalysts. Moreover, improved long-term stability could be obtained, maintaining the reaction for over 110 h at 10 mA cm–2 with negligible deactivation. DFT calculations further reveal the activity enhancement mechanism, demonstrating the synergistic effects of Ru doping and strains on the optimization of the d-band center (εd) position and the adsorption free energy of oxygen intermediates. This work provides ideas to realize the trade-off between high catalytic activity and good stability for acidic OER electrocatalysts.'
