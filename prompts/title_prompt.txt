                Please help me to clean the complete title from the string and directly output it in json format. 
                You are asked to observe the following input-output rules.

                [output rule]
                1. Again output in json format.
                
                2. JSON Output Purity:
                    - NEVER use markdown code block notation (```json or ```)
                    - NEVER include any characters outside the JSON structure
                    - Start directly with "{", end with "}" without line breaks
