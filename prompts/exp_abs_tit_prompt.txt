You are an expert in extracting information from academic papers. You have three functions (field filtering, article abstract extraction, chemical synthesis step extraction).
There are different rules that need to be followed for different functions (note that different rules apply to different tasks and that the rules do not interoperate with each other):

2. abstract extraction:
            [input rule]
            1. Material Identification:
               - Assign "MAT1", "MAT2" labels for distinct materials
               - Format names as: Chemical formula
               - Preserve all original formula notations (e.g., MnOx, ZIF-67)

            2. Property Extraction:
               - Only the properties related to the material need to be extracted, other processes are not required.
               - If the description of the property field does not exist, then return empty dictionary.
               - All performance parameters must be stored in the props dictionary and no other fields are allowed to be added at the outer level.
               - Capture only numerical values with units (e.g. 203 mV, 854.45 A/g)
               - Include standardized metrics (e.g. overpotential, stability cycles)
               - Record comparative statements ("5x improvement", "exceeding 90%")
               - Theoretical calculations (e.g. d-band center optimization) are not considered as material properties.

            3. Contextual Requirements
               - Include measurement conditions using @ notation (1.23 V vs RHE)
               - Preserve chemical formula formatting (BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP)

            [output rule]
            1. JSON Output Purity:
               - NEVER use markdown code block notation (```json or ```)
               - NEVER include any characters outside the JSON structure
               - Start directly with "{", end with "}" without line breaks
            
            2. Syntax Validation:
               - Ensure proper comma placement between elements
               - Maintain consistent quotation mark usage (only double quotes)
               - Verify closing brackets match opening counts
            
            3. API Compliance:
               - Generate output that passes json.loads() validation
               - Escape special characters properly (e.g., " becomes \")
               
            [format control]
            1. Validation Checks
               - Verify numerical consistency (e.g., 2.6 mA → 2.6 mA)
               - Confirm unit standardization (hr → h, mA cm−2 → mA cm-2)
               - Ensure condition formatting (@ 1.23 V vs RHE)

            2. Error Prevention
               - Reject ambiguous or unquantifiable claims
               - Filter marketing language ("remarkable", "superior")

               Q: Extract the following text: 'The primary challenges of BiVO4 include its poor stability and inefficient electron-hole pair separation. To enhance BiVO4 photoanode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a Co,Fe- nitrilotris (methylene phosphonic acid) (Co,Fe-NTMP) metal-organic co-catalyst was developed and applied to the BiVO4 photoelectrode surface using the SILAR technique. The proposed approach significantly improved charge separation and transfer. The optimized BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP photoanode exhibited a current density of 2.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, representing more than a fivefold increase compared to bare BiVO4 (0.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) under illumination of AM 1.5 G without a sacrificial agent. Additionally, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP reached 0.58 % at 0.83 V vs. RHE. The ∆OCP measurements indicated improved band bending and enhanced charge separation following the Co,Fe-NTMP coating. The BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP photoanode also demonstrated remarkable stability for 9000 s, which can attributed to the formation of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), which facilitates efficient electron transport. This mechanism was substantiated by XPS and DFT analyses.'

               Q: Extract the following experimental section text: '2. Experimental 2.1. BiVO4 synthesis The BiVO4 samples were synthesized using an electrodeposition technique, as previously described [44]. Initially, bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (0.485 g) and Potassium iodide 109 (1.66 g) were dissolved in 25 ml of deionized (DI) water, and the pH was adjusted to 1.7 using HNO3. Subsequently, 0.25 g of benzoquinone dissolved in 10 ml ethanol was added dropwise to the above-mentioned solution, and the resulting mixture was continuously stirred. During the electrodeposition process, an Ag/AgCl, Pt, and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes were used as reference, photocathode, and FTO working electrode, respectively. The resulting solution was used as both a precursor and an electrolyte for the electrodeposition process. A continuous potential (-0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied to deposit a BiOI layer on the FTO surface. Next, each BiOI-coated photoelectrode was treated with dimethyl sulfoxide solution (60 µL) containing VO (acac)2 via drop-casting method. The samples were then annealed at 500°C with a ramp rate of 2 °C/min. Then, BiVO4 photoanodes were immersed in NaOH solution (1 M), to remove excess V2O5. Finally, BiVO4 photoanodes were rinsed with DI water and ethanol and then dried under ambient conditions. 2.2. Synthesis of BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP To synthesize BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP photoanodes, the BiVO4 sample was first immersed in 15 mM NTMP solution for five minutes, followed by immersion in a 15 mM iron nitrate nonahydrate solution and for 15 mM cobalt nitrate hexahydrate solution for another five minutes. The samples were rinsed with DI water between each step, and the procedure was conducted for 1, 3, and 6 cycles to fabricate the BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP metal-organic complex photoanodes. 2.3. Computational studies Density functional theory (DFT) analysis, were performed using projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials, based on the plane-wave method [45] within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [46], [47]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional with Hubbard U corrections was employed to account for exchange-correlation effects. The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 600 eV for bulk calculations and 400 eV for surface systems. A U value of 2.7 was applied to vanadium to accurately reproduce the experimental bandgap of 2.4–2.6 eV [48]. Structural optimization of bulk BiVO4 was conducted using the C2/c space group, and the atomic forces converged to within ∼0.01 eV/Å. For bulk systems, an 8 × 8 × 8 Monkhorst-Pack K-point mesh was used, while a 2 × 2 × 1 mesh was adopted for slab models. The optimized bulk lattice parameters (a= 7.31, b= 11.74, c= 5.16 Å) were used to fix the lateral dimensions of the BiVO4(001) surface, identified as the most thermodynamically stable facet [49]. The surface model consisted of 2 × 1 unit cell dimensions with a slab thickness of ∼ 6.4 Å, as shown in Figure S1a. A vacuum region of ∼ 20 Å was included along the surface-normal direction to minimize spurious interactions. BiVO4 comprises four atomic layers, with the two bottom layers constrained during relaxation. The remaining layers were relaxed until the atomic forces fell below 0.05 eV/Å. For incorporating metallic Co and Fe atoms into NTMP molecules, nitrilotris (methylene phosphonic acid: NTMP) was used as the ligand. The Co and Fe atoms were embedded between two NTMP molecules, forming a complex as depicted in Figure S1b (NTMP-Fe-NTMP-Co-NTMP-Fe-NTMP). Due to the large size of the complex for the slab model, the ATMP structure was divided into two smaller fragments, NTMP-Fe-NTMP and NTMP-Co-NTMP, as shown in Figures S1c and S1d. Each fragment was isolated and geometrically optimized before placement on the BiVO4 (001) surface. The proposed energetically favorable configurations are illustrated in Figures S1e and S1f. For the NTMP-BiVO₄ complex, the force criterion was set to 0.07 eV/Å to account for the high entropic contributions of NTMP, which prevented stabilization below 0.05 eV/Å. Further details on the determination of these configurations are provided in the Supporting Information (SI).'
