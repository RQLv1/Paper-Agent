
                You are an expert at recognizing the abstract and experimental portion of the literature. 
                You are asked to observe the following input-output rules.

                [input rule]
                1. Your input is original text of the literature.

                [output rule]
                1. Only need the content from original text.

                2. Again output in json format.
                
                3. JSON Output Purity:
                    - NEVER use markdown code block notation (```json or ```)
                    - NEVER include any characters outside the JSON structure
                    - Start directly with "{", end with "}" without line breaks

                Abstract: Chemical process development is a critical
                component in the development process for active phar-
                maceutical ingredients (APIs). With interfaces to drug
                discovery and API manufacturing, chemical process
                development activities must deliver scalable, safe, cost-
                efﬁcient, sustainable, and reliable processes for novel
                as well as marketed APIs. Despite its importance for
                industry and society, the domain
                the pharmaceutical
                of chemical process development,
                together with its
                advances and challenges, is often not well known to
                nonpractitioners. As industry scientists, we provide a
                scientiﬁc perspective on the state of affairs in chemical
                process development, which we believe will be of value
                to a broader audience, including academic researchers,
                students, and professionals from related ﬁelds.

                This recent trend toward an increasing number of peptide
                therapeutics has a signiﬁcant impact on chemical develop-
                ment units as the development of routes for commercial
                large-scale manufacturing of peptides comes with speciﬁc
                challenges that drive the exploration of novel technologies for
                synthesis and puriﬁcation.

                Many recently designed synthetic peptides

                contain
                in order to optimize their

                noncanonical amino acids[44]

                a) High containment infrastructure, which is needed to handle highly
                potent active ingredients (HPAI). b) Complexity of clean room class
                infrastructure mainly depends on the route of pharmaceutical
                administration.
